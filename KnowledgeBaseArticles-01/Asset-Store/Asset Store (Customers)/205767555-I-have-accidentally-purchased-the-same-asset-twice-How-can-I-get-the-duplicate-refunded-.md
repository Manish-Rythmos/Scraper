**Symptoms**


- I have purchased an asset
- I have received two invoices for my purchase
- I have been charged twice for the asset



**Cause**



If your duplicate invoice(s) are within a few minutes of your original invoice, this may be due to one of these factors:


- a server error at our end
- a server error at the Bank’s end
- a dip in your Internet connection at the time of purchase



**Resolution**



Please contact us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your two invoice numbers (the numbers beginning with ‘3’ at the top right side of your invoice). We will then refund the duplicate if we can see that it is within a few minutes of your original purchase.



**More Information**



Once a refund is processed it can take up to 10 days for the funds to transfer back to your account.
