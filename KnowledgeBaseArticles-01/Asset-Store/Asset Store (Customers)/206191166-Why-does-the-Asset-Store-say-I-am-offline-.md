**Symptoms**


- Every time I try to download an asset it says  *"You are currently offline"*



**Cause**



You want to download Assets that you have purchased from the Asset Store. You try to launch your Unity Asset Store account, but you get a window saying that your are offline even though your Internet connection has not dropped.



**Resolution**



You probably have a firewall or proxy in place. These can block the connection to our servers. To ensure you are  **not**  running the Asset Store from behind a proxy server:


1. Type  *"configure proxy server"*  into the  **Start**  menu bar.
2. Click on  **LAN settings**
3. Uncheck  ***"Use a proxy server for your LAN"***
