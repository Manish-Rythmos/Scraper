**Symptoms**


- I purchased an asset from the APM music section of the Asset Store, but cannot find the APM page in the site to download it
- I previously purchased an APM asset, but cannot find their page to make new purchases
- I would like to purchase an APM music asset and would like to know where to go



**Cause**



As of August 1st, 2016, APM Music is no longer available on the Asset Store.



**Resolution**



If you are a developer based in the United States or Canada and would still like to license APM Music, please [contact them](mailto:info@apmmusic.com), or go to their [website](http://www.apmmusic.com) to search and license their catalog (subject to their direct licensing fees).



Although you will not be able to license APM Music on the Asset Store in the future, any licenses you have already purchased will still be valid according to the specific terms and conditions granted in your license. You will still be able to download any of your purchased tracks from the Asset Store.
