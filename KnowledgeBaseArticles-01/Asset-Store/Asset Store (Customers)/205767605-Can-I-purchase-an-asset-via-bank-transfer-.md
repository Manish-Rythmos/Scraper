**Symptoms**


- I want to purchase an asset
- I do not have a PayPal account
- My credit card will not work in the asset store website



**Cause**



Certain countries have restrictions on PayPal and credit card accounts that do not allow them to send money outside of their country.



**Resolution**



You can absolutely pay for an asset via a bank transfer, but there is a bit of a process to it!



Please follow this process to purchase your asset:


1. Go to the Sales Contact page [here](https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales).
2. Email them to request an asset purchase via bank transfer. You will need to give them the Assetâ€™s name and price as well.
3. They will sell you a voucher, which you will pay for by bank transfer.
4. The voucher will appear on your Asset Store account upon your next sign-in. You can cash it in during checkout to purchase the asset.



Please note: If you are purchasing a voucher for someone else to use, you must ensure that you give the sales team their account details - the email address they use to access Unity - so that the voucher is set up on the correct account.



**More Information**



There is usually a \$1000 minimum on voucher purchases, but your salesperson can give you more information on this.
