<ul>
<li>I&#xA0;have bought an&#xA0;asset from the Asset Store.</li>
<li>I would like to know if I can use it in&#xA0;a game I am going to sell</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>You can purchase assets from the Asset Store and use them personally and commercially in your game.</p>
<p>Downloading assets can be useful since it can save time on creating art for the game.</p>
<p>You may <span class="il">use</span> the majority of <span class="il">assets</span> from the Unity Store in other engines without limitation. Please take some time to look at our terms documentation for further details on limitations of usage. This is found <a href="http://unity3d.com/legal/as_terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>Once you&#xA0;have&#xA0;purchased an <span class="il">asset</span> from the store, it becomes yours to do with as you like within your games and apps. You will be able to <span class="il">use</span> them in your&#xA0;<span class="il">game</span> for commercial <span class="il">use</span> with no extra payments.<br><br>You can also&#xA0;<span class="il">use</span> free <span class="il">assets</span> in your <span class="il">game</span> for commercial <span class="il">use</span>. Using selected (non-restricted) Unity assets is fine, though be aware that many<span class="message_content"> developers use Unity to create their games and most are aware of the assets we provide.</span></p>
<p>Unity &quot;Restricted Assets&quot; are subject to restrictions that others are not. These are only valid for personal and non-commercial use only. No other use is permitted, and these Unity assets must not be used in your commercial games.</p>
<p>You cannot duplicate an asset, or include it in an asset-type product.</p>
