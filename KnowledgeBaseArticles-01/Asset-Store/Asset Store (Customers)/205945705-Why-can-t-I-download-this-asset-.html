        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I have purchased an asset and have received my PDF invoice</span></li>
<li><span>I cannot download the asset.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Assets are not automatically downloaded upon purchase, you need to login to the Unity Editor and find the asset to download it.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Assets are downloaded through the Unity Editor. Please follow this process:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span> Open Unity Editor.</span></li>
<li><span> Click &quot;Window&quot; &gt; &quot;Asset Store&quot;.</span></li>
<li><span> Log in</span></li>
<li><span> Find Asset.</span></li>
<li><span> Click the &#x2018;buy&#x2019; button. If you have already purchased, there will be an option to download or import.</span></li>
<li><span> Download Asset.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>If your asset begins to download, but stops halfway through the process, this could be due to one of these connection issues:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>You have a firewall or proxy in place, which is blocking the connection to the server. Try allowing these ports in your settings: 80 and 443</span></li>
<li><span>You have an anti-viral software running. Please try disabling this and hopefully the asset will finish its download</span></li>
<li><span>You have a weak, or intermittent Internet connection. You can check your connection through many speed check sites such as </span><a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank">Speed Test</a>.</li>
</ul>
