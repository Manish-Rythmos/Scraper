        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I want to purchase an asset</span></li>
<li><span>I do not have a PayPal account</span></li>
<li><span>My credit card will not work in the asset store website</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Certain countries have restrictions on PayPal and credit card accounts that do not allow them to send money outside of their country.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>You can absolutely pay for an asset via a bank transfer, but there is a bit of a process to it!</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow this process to purchase your asset:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to the Sales Contact page <a href="https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></li>
<li><span>Email them to request an asset purchase via bank transfer. You will need to give them the Asset&#x2019;s name and price as well.</span></li>
<li><span>They will sell you a voucher, which you will pay for by bank transfer. </span></li>
<li><span>The voucher will appear on your Asset Store account upon your next sign-in. You can cash it in during checkout to purchase the asset.</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Please note: If you are purchasing a voucher for someone else to use, you must ensure that you give the sales team their account details - the email address they use to access Unity - so that the voucher is set up on the correct account.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>More Information</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>There is usually a $1000 minimum on voucher purchases, but your salesperson can give you more information on this.</span></p>
