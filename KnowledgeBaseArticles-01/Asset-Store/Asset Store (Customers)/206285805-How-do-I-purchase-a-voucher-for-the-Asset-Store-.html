        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I would like to purchase an asset with a voucher</span></li>
<li><span>I would like to purchase an asset for someone else by giving them a voucher</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Since Assets are linked to accounts you cannot make purchases on behalf of another user/customer so a workaround would be to purchase a voucher.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>You will need to contact the <a href="https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sales Team</a> to purchase a voucher. <br></span></p>
<p>Once you have made your purchase, the voucher amount will be added to your Asset Store account. You can then use the balance to purchase assets.</p>
<p>Please note: If you are purchasing a voucher for someone else to use, you must ensure that you give the Sales Team their account details - the email address they use to access Unity - so that the voucher is set up on the correct account.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>More Information</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Please note: There is usually a $1000 minimum on voucher purchases, but your salesperson can give you more information on this.</span></p>
