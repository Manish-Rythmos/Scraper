<ul>
<li><span>I accidentally purchased the wrong asset</span></li>
<li><span>I would like a refund so that I can purchase the correct asset</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>We all make mistakes from time to time. In this case, it may be that you have been looking at two assets, but accidentally purchased the wrong one.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>There are two answers for this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>You have purchased an asset, but would like a different asset from the same Publisher. Please speak with the Publisher directly. They may be willing to agree to a refund of the first asset if you purchase the second asset first.</span></li>
<li><span>You have purchased an asset, but would like an asset from a different Publisher. Again, you will need to speak with the Publisher directly. They may authorise a refund for you, but this is at their discretion and is by no means guaranteed.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>More Information</strong> </span></p>
<p>If a Publisher approves a refund, they will contact us with your invoice number and the name of the asset. After we have received their authorisation it can take up to 10 days for the funds to return to your account.</p>
