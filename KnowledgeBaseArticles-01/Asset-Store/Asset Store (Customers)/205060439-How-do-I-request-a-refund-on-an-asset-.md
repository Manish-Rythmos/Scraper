**Symptoms**


- I have accidentally purchased the wrong asset from the store.
- I have purchased an asset that doesÂ not work as described.
- I have a duplicate purchase.



**Cause**



Duplicate purchases may be caused by server errors, or a blip in connectivity locally. These can be refunded by us, though other types of refund request must go through the Publisher of the asset.



**Resolution**



If you have made a duplicate purchase, please contact us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new), so that we can process your refund.



For all other refund requests, please contact the Publisher of the asset directly. They can then support you, or may offer a refund at their discretion.
