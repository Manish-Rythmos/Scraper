        <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>I have more than one Unity account</span></li>
<li><span>I would like to merge the accounts</span></li>
<li><span>I would like to have all my assets on one account</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>It is possible for users to make more than one account. For example one account on a work email address and one on a personal one. </span></p>
<p><span>You may have several people at one company wishing to use the same assets.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, there is no way to merge accounts, or to transfer assets from one account to another.</span></p>
<p><span>The best thing to do is put the asset files into a secure shared area, where they can be dragged and dropped into projects. Please follow the steps below to do this:<br></span></p>
<p><span>1) Open Unity software and make sure you are logged in with the purchasing account</span></p>
<p><span>2) Find and download the asset (Hit the buy button - if you are in the purchasing account, it will then give you the option to download)</span></p>
<p><span>3) Once the download is complete, the assets&apos; files can be found in these locations:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Windows - User&gt;AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Unity&gt; Asset Store</li>
<li>Mac - User&gt;Library&gt;Unity&gt;Asset Store</li>
</ul>
<p>3) Drag and drop the assets&apos; files into a shared area. This might be an area within your secure network, or a Dropbox which only your employees have access to</p>
<p>4) Employees or co-workers can then download the assets for use in their projects by dragging and dropping them from the shared area into their open Unity project</p>
<p><span>Please note: Updates to the assets must be done through the purchasing account.</span></p>
