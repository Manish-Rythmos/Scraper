**Symptoms**


- I have more than one Unity account
- I would like to merge the accounts
- I would like to have all my assets on one account



**Cause**



It is possible for users to make more than one account. For example one account on a work email address and one on a personal one.



You may have several people at one company wishing to use the same assets.



**Resolution**



Unfortunately, there is no way to merge accounts, or to transfer assets from one account to another.



The best thing to do is put the asset files into a secure shared area, where they can be dragged and dropped into projects. Please follow the steps below to do this:



1) Open Unity software and make sure you are logged in with the purchasing account



2) Find and download the asset (Hit the buy button - if you are in the purchasing account, it will then give you the option to download)



3) Once the download is complete, the assets' files can be found in these locations:


- Windows - User>AppData>Roaming>Unity> Asset Store
- Mac - User>Library>Unity>Asset Store



3) Drag and drop the assets' files into a shared area. This might be an area within your secure network, or a Dropbox which only your employees have access to



4) Employees or co-workers can then download the assets for use in their projects by dragging and dropping them from the shared area into their open Unity project



Please note: Updates to the assets must be done through the purchasing account.
