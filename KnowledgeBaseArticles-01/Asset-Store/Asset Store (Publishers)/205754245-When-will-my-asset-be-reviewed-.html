        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>My asset has been pending review for a while.</li>
<li>I have not heard back from the Asset Review Team about my asset.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>The Review Team do get quite a bit of back log because of the sheer number of assets submitted. They will&#xA0;work as fast as they can to get through all of the reviews, but there may be&#xA0;a longer wait time than there has been previously.</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this causes.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>Currently assets are taking up to 14 days to clear the review process.</p>
<p>If your&#xA0;asset is showing as &quot;Pending&quot;, then it&#xA0;is still waiting to be reviewed. We ask that you be patient and we will send you an e-mail when the asset is Approved or declined.</p>
<p><span>If your asset has been pending for more than 14 days, please contact Support</span> <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a><span> with the full name of your asset and we will ask the Review Team for more information on your case.</span></p>
