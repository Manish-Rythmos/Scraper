        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I have created a service that I would like to publish to the Asset Store</span></li>
<li><span>I feel that my service solves a problem that a lot of users/ Publishers have</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Whether you have created a new SDK, a complex MMO networking service, or a different service, you can contact our Team directly about opportunities.<br></span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> <br>If you are a service provider where a variable amount of money changes hands after the user downloads your SDK or plugin, you may not upload your SDK or plugin in the usual way. Please contact Ron Shepherd (rons@unity3d.com) directly to discuss other partnership opportunities that may be available.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>More Information</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>The Asset Store suggest when submitting your SDK or plugin, to put it in the Scripting&gt;Integration category or Services category.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on how to submit an asset to the Asset Store then see this article <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205692539" target="_blank">here</a></span></p>
