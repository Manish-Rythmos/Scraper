<ul>
<li><span>I would like to know how likely it is for my asset to be chosen for the Asset Store sales</span></li>
<li><span>I would like to know if I need to submit a form for each package that we plan to add in the sales promotion</span></li>
<li><span>I would like to know if there a minimum discount price we have to offer</span></li>
<li><span>Does having a sale promotion on a package limit in any way the sales of our other packages? </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Causes</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Sales can be a great way of raising awareness of your asset and increasing user purchases. <br></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>When you apply for the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/unity3d.com/forms/d/1eL91dQ2uttWV0hyIPjiYizP98BIxQOfrNx95NfJiLqI/viewform" target="_blank">Unity Asset Store sales</a>, there is no specific time frame in which your asset will be included in the sales. There also is no guarantee that particular assets will be chosen. We receive a large number of submissions - so we ask Publishers to apply, in order for our Asset Store team to decide which assets they believe will sell well on the Store and be of particular use to our Unity users.</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to submit a separate form for each asset you would like to put up for Asset Store Sale. Due to the high volume of applications, the likeliness of all of your assets being included in a sale is slim, but there is nothing to stop you applying for them all! </span></p>
<p><span>Putting your asset up for sales will not necessarily limit the sales of your other assets. It could even raise your Publisher profile. However, the Asset Store sales are not solely used for promotional purposes and also seek to track down the best assets for users. We advise self-promotion via your own website and social media sites also.</span></p>
