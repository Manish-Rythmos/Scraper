        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I Have submitted an Asset to to the Asset Store, and would like to know how long I will have to wait for it to be approved</li>
<li>How long is the queue once an Asset is submitted?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>Customers who have submitted an Asset to the Asset Store may wish to know how long they will wait to hear back if the Asset is going to be published.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>Once a customer has submitted an Asset to the Asset Store they will be put into a queuing system, the Asset will be seen in time by a member of the Asset Store team for pending review. This process cannot be sped up, but making sure all parts of the Asset/package are working and correct will allow your asset to be reviewed more quickly.</p>
<p>Usually the wait time is under two weeks, or 10 working days.</p>
<p>When your package has been approved, its status will change to  <em>Published</em>  and it will be live in the Asset Store! If your package is not approved, the status of the package will change to  <em>Declined</em> . If this is the case, please update your package based on the comments sent to you and resubmit it.</p>
