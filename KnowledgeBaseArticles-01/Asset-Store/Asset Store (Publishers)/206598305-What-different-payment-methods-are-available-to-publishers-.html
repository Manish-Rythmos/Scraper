</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Most of our Publishers receive their payout through PayPal, though there can be issues with this if you are in a country with government restrictions on payments.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Most Publishers choose to get paid through PayPal. This is a monthly transfer with no fee. It is sent out on the 15th of each month and is usually in your PayPal account between the 15th and 18th.</span></p>
<p><span>Larger companies, or Publishers with PayPal issues (for example those in Greece, the Ukraine, or Russia) tend to go with Wire transfer payment, which is a quarterly transfer to your bank account with a $250 minimum and a $20 admin fee. The payments for those get sent out in January, April, July and October. If your quarterly earnings are under $250, the payout rolls over until it reaches a quarter that there is over $250 in your account.</span></p>
<p><span>In the US, you can also choose to have a quarterly cheque payment sent to you. There is a $15 transaction fee for this and the dates are as above.</span></p>
