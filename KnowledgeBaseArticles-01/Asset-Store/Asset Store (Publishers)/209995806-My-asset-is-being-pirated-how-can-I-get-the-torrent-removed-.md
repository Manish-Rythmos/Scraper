**Symptoms**


- I have found my asset(s) on a torrent site that is allowing anyone to download it for free.
- I wish to remove my files from a website pirating my assets(s).



**Cause**



Once a user has your asset files, unfortunately it is technically possible for them to share these on torrent sites.



**Resolution**



To remove a torrent, or any other pirated copy of your asset, from a website you should make a DMCA take-down (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) request to the Administrator of that site.



This is a copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).



This will allow you to flag a webpage/website for a take-down: http://www.dmca.com/



*Note: Unity Technologies will not be able to remove assets that have infringed copyrights unless the asset is being distributed on the Unity website/answers/forums or Asset Store.*



**More Information**



If the pirated material is on our own Asset Store, please follow the guidance in this article:
