<p><span>Unity has a Private sub-Forum for its Publishers. <br></span></p>
<p>The Forum is private to ensure it is a secure area for Publishers to discuss topics openly, but all established Asset Store Publishers are welcome.&#xA0; To gain access, you have to have permission from the Forum Administrators. <span>You can apply for access <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/5yai5oJdfriVn6w93" target="_blank">here</a>.</span></p>
