<ul>
<li>I am an Asset Store Publisher</li>
<li>I need to know how to provide proof of my earnings from the Asset Store for tax purposes</li>
<li>How can I prove that I am a Asset Store Publisher?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> &#xA0;</p>
<p>Tax offices in certain countries require proof of earnings for their records.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>We cannot provide any specific documentation for earnings to Publishers of the Asset Store, or tax advice or invoices intended for customers to Publishers. This is due to the fact that we do not know Publishers&apos; specific operating models and we could be held liable on any general advice or documentation given.</p>
<p>To prove Asset Store earnings, Publishers can screenshot the Sales/Earnings pages from their Publisher Asset Store Admin account. This will provide proof for taxes and earnings.&#xA0;</p>
