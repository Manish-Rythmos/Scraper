**Symptoms**


- I am an Asset Store Publisher
- I want to network with other Publishers
- I would like to get tips from other Publishers



**Cause**



The Publishers' Forum can be a good way to network with other Publishers and receive tips about asset or app publishing.



**Resolution**



Unity has a Private sub-Forum for its Publishers.



The Forum is private to ensure it is a secure area for Publishers to discuss topics openly, but all established Asset Store Publishers are welcome.Â  To gain access, you have to have permission from the Forum Administrators. You can apply for access [here](https://goo.gl/forms/5yai5oJdfriVn6w93).
