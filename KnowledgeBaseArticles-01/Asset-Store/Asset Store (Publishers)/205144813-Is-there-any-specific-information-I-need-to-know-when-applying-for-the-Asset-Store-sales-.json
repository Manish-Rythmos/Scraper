Due to the high volume of applications, the likeliness of all of your assets being included in a sale is slim, but there is nothing to stop you applying for them all! </span>","<span>Putting your asset up for sales will not necessarily limit the sales of your other assets. It could even raise your Publisher profile. However, the Asset Store sales are not solely used for promotional purposes and also seek to track down the best assets for users. We advise self-promotion via your own website and social media sites also.</span>"]}]}]
