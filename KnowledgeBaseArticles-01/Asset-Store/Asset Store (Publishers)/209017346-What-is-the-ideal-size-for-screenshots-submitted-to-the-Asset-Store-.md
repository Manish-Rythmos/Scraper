**Symptoms**


- I am submitting a Asset to the Store
- I would like to know what size is best for any screenshots of my product I have



**Cause**



If you are submitting a Asset to the Asset Store, it is important to include as much information as possible to attract potential customers. Some websites limit the size of images you can use, though we do not do that.



**Resolution**



You can upload a screenshot to the Asset Store in any size. They are automatically scaled down to a size of 785x480 for the package page.



**More Information**
