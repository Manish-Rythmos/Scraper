<ul>
<li>I am upgrading my asset and would like my existing customers to receive the update for free</li>
<li>I would like to know how to make my upgrade free to my existing customers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Causes</span></strong> </p>
<p>You want to update and submit a new version of your asset on the Asset Store.</p>
<p>You do not however, want the customers who have already purchased your asset to have to purchase it again.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolutions</strong> </span></p>
<p>To make your asset upgrade free to your existing customers, you can enter a grace period (a certain amount of days) for the free upgrade to be valid.</p>
<p>Customers that have purchased your old package within that grace period will be able to get the new package for free. For example, if a Publisher set a grace period of 3 months on his upgrade this would mean that all customers that had purchased in the past 3 months would receive the upgrade for free. Customers that purchased the asset prior to the 3 month grace period would have to pay for the upgrade.</p>
<p>You can set a grace period within your Publisher Administration account under the tab &#x2018;Upgrades&#x2019;. It is not part of the submission process.</p>
