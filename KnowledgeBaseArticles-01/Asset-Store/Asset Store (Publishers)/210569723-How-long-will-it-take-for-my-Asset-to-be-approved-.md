**Symptoms**


- I Have submitted an Asset to to the Asset Store, and would like to know how long I will have to wait for it to be approved
- How long is the queue once an Asset is submitted?



**Cause**



Customers who have submitted an Asset to the Asset Store may wish to know how long they will wait to hear back if the Asset is going to be published.



**Resolution**



Once a customer has submitted an Asset to the Asset Store they will be put into a queuing system, the Asset will be seen in time by a member of the Asset Store team for pending review. This process cannot be sped up, but making sure all parts of the Asset/package are working and correct will allow your asset to be reviewed more quickly.



Usually the wait time is under two weeks, or 10 working days.



When your package has been approved, its status will change to  *Published*  and it will be live in the Asset Store! If your package is not approved, the status of the package will change to  *Declined* . If this is the case, please update your package based on the comments sent to you and resubmit it.
