**Symptoms**


- My asset has been declined from the Asset Store
- I would like more feedback to understand why my asset has been declined



**Cause**



The Asset Review team have high standards for assets sold on our Asset Store. As a result, they cannot accept every asset that is submitted.



**Resolution**



The Review Team usually give specific feedback via email. If you have not received a clear reason why your asset has been declined, it may be due to one of these common reasons:


- There is already an asset similar to yours on the store. We want to encourage diversity on our Store as much as possible.
- The art style needs work as it does not currently meet our standards. We want to host the best possible assets for our users.
- Your asset does not meet the [submission guidelines](http://unity3d.com/asset-store/sell-assets/submission-guidelines#package-manager). Please review these to be sure that you have included all necessary files
