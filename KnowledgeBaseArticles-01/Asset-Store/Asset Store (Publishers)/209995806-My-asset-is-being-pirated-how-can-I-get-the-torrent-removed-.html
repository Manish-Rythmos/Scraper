        <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have found my asset(s) on a torrent site that is allowing anyone to download it for free.</li>
<li>I wish to remove my files from a website pirating my assets(s).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>Once a user has your asset files, unfortunately it is technically possible for them to share these on torrent sites. </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>To remove a torrent, or any other pirated copy of your asset, from a website you should make a DMCA take-down (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) request to the Administrator of that site.</p>
<p>This is a&#xA0;copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).</p>
<p>This will allow you to flag a webpage/website for a take-down:&#xA0;http://www.dmca.com/</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-color-red90"><em>Note: Unity Technologies will not be able to remove assets that have infringed copyrights unless the asset is being distributed on the Unity website/answers/forums or Asset Store.</em> </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">More Information</span></strong> </p>
<p>If the pirated material is on our own Asset Store, please follow the guidance in this article:</p>
