        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I have sent in a sales request form</li>
<li>I want to know how I will find out about the sale</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>If you have submitted a request to be included in a sale <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/unity3d.com/forms/d/1eL91dQ2uttWV0hyIPjiYizP98BIxQOfrNx95NfJiLqI/viewform%20" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>It may be some time before you hear back from the Review Team with the results. This is because we receive many requests and want to ensure that the best possible assets get included in our promotions and sales.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>If the Review Team select your asset to be part of a sale or deal, they will send an email to the address attached to your Publisher account.</p>
<p>This will let you know when your asset will go on sale and the type of promotion it will be part of.</p>
