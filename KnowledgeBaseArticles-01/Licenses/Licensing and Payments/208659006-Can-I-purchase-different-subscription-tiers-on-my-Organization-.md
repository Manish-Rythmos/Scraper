**Symptoms**


- I wish to purchase several subscriptions for my Organization
- I would like to know if it is possible to mix different subscription tiers



**Cause**



Unity offer different levels or 'tiers' for our subscriptions, which means that users on different tiers have different levels of access to Services and different prices.



**Resolution**



As stated in our [EULA](http://unity3d.com/legal/eula), different tiers cannot be mixed together. For example Pro tier subscriptions cannot be mixed with the Personal Edition, or Personal Plus.



Due to this, customers should not own subscriptions on different tiers.



**More Information**



To see the different Subscription tiers available, please go to our [Store](https://store.unity.com/) page.
