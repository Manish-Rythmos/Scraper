**Symptoms**


- I purchased a subscription on a monthly payment plan
- I want to pay off the rest of my 12 month contract in one now, rather than being charged each month



**Cause**



We have two options at check-out - monthly and prepaid, but if circumstances change, you may wish to switch plans.







**Resolution**



Follow these steps to pay off the amount remaining on your contract:


1. Sign in [here](https://id.unity.com/) if you are the Owner of the Organization that the seat(s) are attached to
2. Go to the "Organizations" tab and select the subscription that you want to pay off
3. On the next page, select the "Cog" icon to manage the subscription ![Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.35.38.png](/hc/article_attachments/115006579443/Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.35.38.png)
4. Find the "Subscription progress" blue bar and press the "Pay for remaining period" button.![Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.36.46.png](/hc/article_attachments/115006579463/Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.36.46.png)
5. You will see a page that confirms the amount owed to pay for the rest of your commitment period and the card details for your payment card. If all is well, hit the "Confirm" button to proceed.
