Ads, Analytics, Cloud Build, Collaborate, Multiplayer, and/or Performance Reporting\n\nCause\nUnity provided Pro-level services to Unity 5 Pro perpetual license holders. This obligation ends with the conclusion of the Unity 5 cycle.For the purposes of Unity Services, impacted projects are treated as if they are operated by a Unity Personal Edition license holder. Specific services are impacted as follows:-\nCloud Build: reverts to Personal tier, which results in slower build times. The Personal tier includes Standard Queue: builds are queued and created in the order received, across all customers. This impacts new and existing projects.\nAnalytics: reverts to Personal tier, which includes Core Analytics. No access to Livestream, Heatmaps or Raw Data Export for new projects.\nMultiplayer: reverts to Personal tier. Number of included Concurrent users reverts from 200 to 20 for projects.\nPerformance Reporting: Cannot be enabled for new projects. Data is still collected for existing projects, but is not viewable from the developer dashboard.No impacts to other services.\nResolutionFor Pro-level services, purchase a new Unity Pro subscription.\n","content":[]}]}]
