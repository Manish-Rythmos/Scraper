**Symptoms**


- I would like to know if there will be a Unity 6 version release
- I would like to know if I will be able to upgrade to Unity 6.x at some point.



**Cause**



Our previous licence model revolved around large version releases, however we are moving to a new licensing model.



**Resolution**



No, there will not be a Unity 6 release. For more information about why we will not release Unity 6, please read this [Blog post](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/06/05/subscription-why/) by Unityâ€™s co-founder and CTO, Joachim Ante.
