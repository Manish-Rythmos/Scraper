        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I purchased a subscription on a monthly payment plan</li>
<li>I want to pay off the rest of my 12 month contract in one now, rather than being charged each month</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We have two options at check-out - monthly and prepaid, but if circumstances change, you may wish to switch plans.</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Follow these steps to pay off the amount remaining on your contract:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in <a href="https://id.unity.com/" target="_blank">here</a> if you are the Owner of the Organization that the seat(s) are attached to</li>
<li>Go to the &quot;Organizations&quot; tab and select the subscription that you want to pay off</li>
<li>On the next page, select the &quot;Cog&quot; icon to manage the subscription <img src="/hc/article_attachments/115006579443/Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.35.38.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.35.38.png"></li>
<li>Find the &quot;Subscription progress&quot; blue bar and press the &quot;Pay for remaining period&quot; button.<img src="/hc/article_attachments/115006579463/Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.36.46.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_12.36.46.png"></li>
<li>You will see a page that confirms the amount owed to pay for the rest of your commitment period and the card details for your payment card. If all is well, hit the &quot;Confirm&quot; button to proceed.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
