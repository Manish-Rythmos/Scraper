        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to know if I can sell a game that I made in Unity, without buying a Professional license.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may be an Indie developer using Personal Edition. You want to sell a game you have made and&#xA0;do not want to purchase a Professional License.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You can absolutely sell commercial games made in the Personal Edition of Unity. To do this, you must&#xA0;meet the requirements to use Unity Personal Edition, mainly that&#xA0;you did not earn/receive more than $100,000 in revenue/funding in the last fiscal year.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>If you are a &apos;independent/solo developer&apos; - revenue earned is based on personal revenue made from using Unity in the last fiscal year. I.e money earned from Unity Ads or games published.<br></p>
<p>If you wish to use Unity Personal Edition whilst working for a company, the $100,000 cap is in relation to the entire company&apos;s overall earned revenue or funding for the last fiscal year.</p>
