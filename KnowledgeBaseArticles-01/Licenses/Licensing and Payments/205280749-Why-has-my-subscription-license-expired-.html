        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot use my Pro subscription license<br></li>
<li>I have received an email stating that my flexible plan subscription will be deactivated if payments are not made</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>Your subscription license can expire if you are out of your 12 month commitment period and part of the flexible plan. If you have missed a payment, there is a 27 day period to give you time to update your details. If the payment has not been made after this, your license will automatically expire.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>If your subscription is on a flexible plan, the subscription will be deactivated if payments have not been made in the 27 days after the due date.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, once this has happened there is no way to retrieve your subscription. If a Pro subscription is needed, then a new subscription must be purchased and a further 12 month commitment period is necessary. </p>
