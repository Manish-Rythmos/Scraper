        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have been over charged for my subscription.</li>
<li>The invoice I have received lists VAT as part of my payment.</li>
<li>The VAT number was set correctly before the bill date and I was not expecting this.&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This happens when the&#xA0;account linked to the subscription payments is used to purchase from the Asset Store. If the VAT number is not entered correctly, it will trigger the subscription billing information to change too.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately we cannot refund VAT on invoices.&#xA0;You will need to make sure that you have all the correct information entered each time you purchase from the Asset Store.</p>
<p>To make sure your VAT number is entered correctly via the online store, follow this process:</p>
<p>1. Go <a href="https://accounts.unity3d.com/sign-in" target="_blank">here</a><br>2. Log in to the account attached to the subscription<br>3. Go <a href="https://store.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">here</a><br>4. Click &quot;My Account&quot;<br>5. Click &quot;Billing details&quot;<br>6. Change details or the VAT number and save.</p>
