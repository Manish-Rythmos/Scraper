**Symptoms**


- I would like to know if my Unity subscription will automatically renew after my 12 month subscription has finished
- My subscription contract is coming to an end



**Cause**



You may want to ensure that your subscription will continue, or cancel your subscription after your last payment.



**Resolution**



For both Pro and Plus, subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of your commitment period. If you do not wish to renew your subscription at the end of your commitment period, you can always stop the auto-renewal through the process found [here](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/205767715).



For licenses purchased after June 28th 2016 only:



If you choose to keep the subscription going, there will be different options available when you auto-renew. You can choose to downgrade your Pro plan to Plus, or choose a different payment plan. In all cases, the site will tell you the price at the bottom of the page. Click 'save' to confirm your choice.![Screen_Shot_2017-03-21_at_11.44.29.png](/hc/article_attachments/115004089823/Screen_Shot_2017-03-21_at_11.44.29.png)
