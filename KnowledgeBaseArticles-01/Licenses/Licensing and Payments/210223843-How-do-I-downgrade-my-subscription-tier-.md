**Symptoms**


- I am a Unity subscription owner
- I would like to downgrade to a lower tier of the subscription service



**Cause**



We offer different tiers of subscriptions, which have different levels of access to Unity Services and different pricing levels.



**Resolution**



If you are within your 12 month contract, it is not possible to downgrade your subscription plan.



It is however, possible to upgrade your subscription to a higher tier if increased access to Unity Services is required.



If you wish to discuss your subscription tier, you can contact Support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).



**More Information**



Please note that the above contractual obligation also applies to other contracted subscriptions, for example Premium Support and Source Code access.
