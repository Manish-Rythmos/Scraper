        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to put my subscription on hold.</li>
<li>I do not want to lose my subscription permanently, but do not want to restart the 12 month commitment period again.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>You may have run into financial difficultly and cannot afford the subscription for a few months.</p>
<p>The specific project you were working on may have stopped and you need to put the subscription on hold until you next find work.</p>
<p><strong>Resolutions</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, subscriptions cannot be put on hold. This applies to users who are within the 12 month commitment period and part of the flexible plan.</p>
<p>Subscriptions are a continuous contract. They can be cancelled as part of the flexible plan, however if a new subscription is wanted, a further 12 month minimum commitment period will be necessary. There is no option to pause subscriptions.</p>
