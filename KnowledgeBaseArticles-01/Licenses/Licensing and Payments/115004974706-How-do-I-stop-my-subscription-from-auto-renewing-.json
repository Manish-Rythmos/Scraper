Sign into your Unity account page at id.unity.com","2. Click on &apos;Organizations&apos;, then click on the Organization name containing&#xA0;your Plus or Pro subscription.","3. Under &apos;Subscriptions&apos; click &apos;Manage&apos; (the cog icon), then click &apos;Manage Subscription&apos; on the following page.&#xA0;","4.
