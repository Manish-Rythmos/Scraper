**Symptoms**


- I have purchased a subscription within the last 7 days and I have realized I do not need it.



**Causes**



You may not have realized that there was a 12 month commitment period and you are unable to commit to this contract.



It could also be that you thought that the subscription contract was on a month to month basis, and that you could cancel at any time.



**Resolutions**



If your serial key has not yet been activated, please get in touch and we will see what we can do to help.



If your serial key has been activated, unfortunately our subscription team may not be able to cancel your license.
