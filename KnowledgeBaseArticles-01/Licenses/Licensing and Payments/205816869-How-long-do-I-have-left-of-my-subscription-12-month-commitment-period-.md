**Symptoms**


- I want to cancel my subscription, but do not know how many months are left of my 12 month commitment period.
- I would like to know if my subscription has an expiry date.



**Causes**



You may want to know when your commitment period ends, if you would like to cancel your subscription after 12 months.



**Resolution**



If you are curious to how many months are left in your 12 month commitment period, please contact Support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new) with either your serial number, Organization name, or the email address that is attached to the license.



If you still have your original purchasing email and invoice, this should also indicate when your 12 month commitment period has been completed.
