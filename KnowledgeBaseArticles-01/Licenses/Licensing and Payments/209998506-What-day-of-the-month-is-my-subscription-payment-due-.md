**Symptoms**


- I would like to know where to view the payment date for my subscription
- I would like to know the date that my subscription payments come out of my account



**Cause**



Payment dates for your subscription(s) can be different if they are assigned to different OrganiZations. This can be confusing if you are unable to see what the payment date is for the subscriptions



**Resolution**



If your subscription was purchased before June 28th 2016, it will be on our old system, which charges on the 1st of each month. If however, your subscription was purchased after 28th June 2016, your payment date will be the date you purchased each month.



To view the payment date for your subscription follow the steps below:


1. Log in to your account: [https://id.unity.com](https://id.unity.com)
2. Click "Organizations".
3. Click on the OrganiZation that your licenses are attached to.
4. Click "Seats & Services"
5. Click the "Manage Seats" icon to the right of your license.

**More Information**



Note: All the licenses in an Organization will share the same payment date, however, you may have licenses in a different Organization that has a different payment date. Unfortunately it is not possible to change a subscription's payment date.



If you add more subscriptions to an OrganiZation, they will inherit the payment date of subscriptions already existing in that Organization.
