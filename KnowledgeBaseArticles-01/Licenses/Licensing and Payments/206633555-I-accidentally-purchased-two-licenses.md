**Symptoms**


- I have purchased a Unity Professional License from the Online Store
- I have received two invoices for my purchase
- I have been charged twice for my License purchase



**Cause**



This is an error that can sometimes occur due to one of these factors:


- a server error at our end
- a server error with the banks online system
- a dip in your Internet connection at the time of purchase



**Resolution**



Please contact support with both PDF Invoices you received from Unity or the Invoice numbers  *IN3XXXXXXXX* . We will then refund the duplicate.



You can contact support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).



***Please note, licenses can only be refunded if the request is made within 7 days of making a purchase AND the customer has not yet activated the Unity license.***



**More Information**



Once a refund is processed it can take up to 10 days for the funds to transfer back to your account.
