        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I received a voucher/ discount coupon from Unity, for example Essentials Pack or a license trial</li>
<li>I follow the link in my email to redeem the voucher, but then get an error, for example &quot;code invalid&quot;</li>
<li>My voucher does not work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If the billing information in your Unity Organization is not fully filled out, the voucher cannot be added to your account.<br></p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Ensure your billing information is filled out and up to date and attempt to redeem the voucher again. </p>
<p>If you still have difficulty, <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">send us</a> the details and the voucher code so that we can investigate.</p>
