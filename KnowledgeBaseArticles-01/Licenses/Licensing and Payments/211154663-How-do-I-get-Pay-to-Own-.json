You will receive the next 3 patches. We reserve the right to grant access to additional patches in the event that we find severe bugs.","If you later resume subscribing, you will still own the perpetual license you elected, but again start receiving updates, fixes and Services. Once you have subscribed for another 24 consecutive months, if you should then elect to cease this new subscription, you will then be granted a new perpetual license of the then current version of Unity."]}]}]
