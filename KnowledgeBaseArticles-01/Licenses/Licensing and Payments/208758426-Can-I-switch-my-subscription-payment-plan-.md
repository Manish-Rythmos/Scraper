**Symptoms**


- I have set up a Unity Pro subscription with an annual payment plan and would like to change to month-to-month payments
- I would like to change my subscription payment plan



**Cause**



You can change your subscription tier, but not the payment plan.



**Resolution**



Unfortunately, you cannot make a change to your payment plan during the commitment period of your current subscription. OnceÂ after the initial commitment period is up and you are in a flexible plan, you can move to a no-commitment plan and pay in monthly instalments.
