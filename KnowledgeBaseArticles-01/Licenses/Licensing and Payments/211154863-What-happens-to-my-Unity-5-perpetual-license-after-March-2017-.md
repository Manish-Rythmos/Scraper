**Symptoms**


- I am the owner of a 5.x perpetual license
- I would like to know what will happen to my license after March 2017



**Cause**



As mentioned in our [Blog](http://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/06/16/evolution-of-our-products-and-pricing/), we are switching to a subscription model for licenses.



**Resolution**



You get to keep your perpetual licenses for Unity 5, but there will be no more new features after March 2017. We will continue to provide critical patches as we have done for older versions of Unity.
