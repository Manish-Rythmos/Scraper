        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have received an email stating that my subscription has not been paid this month</li>
<li>My Subscription has been suspended</li>
<li>I cannot use my Unity Pro subscription</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>If your subscription payments are failing, it will generally be to do with the credit card you are using. For example, your card may have reached its credit limit.</p>
<p>It may also be that there is a general banking error with your card and that you have to contact your bank to assist you with this issue. In rare cases, your card details may be invalid, or that your card has flagged a high fraud score when processing the payment.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>For licenses purchased before 28th June 2016, please see below.</p>
<p>Firstly, please ensure that you have entered the correct information into your subscription billing details. The details we have must match what the bank has on record exactly. Please pay particular attention to the format of these things:</p>
