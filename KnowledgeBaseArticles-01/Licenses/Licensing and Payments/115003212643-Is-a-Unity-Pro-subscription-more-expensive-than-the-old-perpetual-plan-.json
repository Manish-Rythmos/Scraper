Although existing perpetual licenses are still avaliable to use for as long as you so wish, to receive access to the new version of Unity.2017, updates and features a subscription is neccessary."]},{"title":"Resolution","content":["Unity Pro perpetual licences used to be $1,500. This was for a Pro license only, without iOS and Android add-ons. The option to acquire the mobile add-ons was again $1500 each, totalling at $4,500 for a Pro license with iOS and Android capabilities.","If you consider a 24 months cycle, the price for using a new Unity Pro subscription is $3000.","It is true, that if mobile deployment options are not a priority for you, that the cost of using Unity has indeed increased. However, with all platforms included in one license, this opens up many opportunities.","Furthermore, we introduced a third tier of licensing, Unity Plus. This is suitable for smaller companies or individuals with an annual revenue or funds capacity of below $200,000 per fiscal year."]},{"title":"More Information","content":["To find out more about the licensing tiers for our new subscription, please take a look at the Unity store <a href=\"https://store.unity.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>."]}]}]
