**Symptoms**


- I am looking in my Unity account, but I cannot see a way to add seats to my license.



**Cause**



You may have had more members join your project team and would like to add more seats so that they can use the license.



Only the Owner of the Unity Organization that the license was purchased on can add seats to a license. So if you cannot see a way to do this, please check who is listed as the Owner of the Organization.



**Resolution**



To add seats to your license. Start by having the Owner sign into the account linked to the Organization [here](https://id.unity.com/en/conversations/09998090-0b88-4d14-a7e0-f118c600e86d005f). Then click "Organizations."

Next, go to the Organization that has the subscription attached to it. Click "Seats & Services."

You will then need to scroll down and click the 'Add more seats" tab. Add however many extra seats you need and confirm the extra cost:
