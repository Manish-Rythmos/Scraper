<p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have set up a Unity Pro subscription with an annual payment plan and would like to change to month-to-month payments</li>
<li>I would like to change my subscription payment plan</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You can change your subscription tier, but not the payment plan.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot make a change to your payment plan during the commitment period of your current subscription. Once&#xA0;after the initial commitment period is up and you are in a flexible plan, you can move to a no-commitment plan and pay in monthly instalments.&#xA0;</p>
