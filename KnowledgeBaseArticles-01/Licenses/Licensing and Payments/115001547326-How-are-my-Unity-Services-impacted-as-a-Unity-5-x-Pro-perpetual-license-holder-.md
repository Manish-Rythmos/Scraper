**Symptoms**


- I have a Unity 5 Pro perpetual license
- I use Unity Services. Ads, Analytics, Cloud Build, Collaborate, Multiplayer, and/or Performance Reporting



**Cause**



Unity provided Pro-level services to Unity 5 Pro perpetual license holders. This obligation ends with the conclusion of the Unity 5 cycle.
For the purposes of Unity Services, impacted projects are treated as if they are operated by a Unity Personal Edition license holder. Specific services are impacted as follows:-



***Cloud Build:***  reverts to Personal tier, which results in slower build times. The Personal tier includes Standard Queue: builds are queued and created in the order received, across all customers. This impacts new and existing projects.



***Analytics:***  reverts to Personal tier, which includes Core Analytics. No access to Livestream, Heatmaps or Raw Data Export for new projects.



***Multiplayer:***  reverts to Personal tier. Number of included Concurrent users reverts from 200 to 20 for projects.



***Performance Reporting:***  Cannot be enabled for new projects. Data is still collected for existing projects, but is not viewable from the developer dashboard.
No impacts to other services.



**Resolution** 
For Pro-level services, purchase a new [Unity Pro subscription](https://store.unity.com/products/unity-pro).
