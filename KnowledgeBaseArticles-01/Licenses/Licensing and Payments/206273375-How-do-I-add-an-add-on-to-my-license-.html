        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have a Unity Pro license, but I need to build to mobile platforms.</li>
<li>I would like to know how I can add an add-on to an existing license.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If you have a Pro license, in the past you needed to purchase iOS Pro and/or Android Pro add-ons separately to deploy to mobile&#xA0;platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>As of June 28th 2016, our licenses include the iOS and Android add-ons at no extra cost. This means that if you have a Pro or Plus subscription, you can deploy to iOS and Android without an add-on.</p>
<p>Personal Edition users also have iOS and Android deployment included for free.</p>
