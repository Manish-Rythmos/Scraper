        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have purchased a Unity Professional License from the Online Store</li>
<li>I have received two invoices for my purchase</li>
<li>I have been charged twice for my License purchase</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This is an error that can sometimes occur due to one of these factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>a server error at our end</li>
<li>a server error&#xA0;with the banks online system</li>
<li>a dip in your Internet connection at the time of purchase</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Please contact&#xA0;support&#xA0;with both PDF Invoices you received from Unity or the Invoice numbers&#xA0; <em>IN3XXXXXXXX</em> . We will then refund the duplicate.</p>
<p>You can contact support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note, licenses can only be refunded if the request is made&#xA0;within 7 days of making a purchase AND the customer has not yet activated the Unity license.</em> </strong> </p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>Once a refund is processed it can take up to 10 days for the funds to transfer back to your account.</p>
