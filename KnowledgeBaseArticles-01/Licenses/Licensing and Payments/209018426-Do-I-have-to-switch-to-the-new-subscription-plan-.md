**Symptoms**


- I wish to know if I must switch subscription plans
- I would like to know if switching to the new subscription plans is mandatory



**Causes**



Due to the new licensing models introduced in June 2016, you would like to know if it is essential that you switch to a new subscription plan and if so, when you must do this by.
**Resolution**



***Unity Pro subscribers:***



No, you can continue to develop with your current subscription(s) until June, 2018. After that date, your existing subscription(s) will revert to Unity Personal.



For subscribers currently paying \$150 and \$225/month however, the new Pro subscription, at \$125/month costs less and gets you access to new features not available with your current subscriptions!



***Unity perpetual license holders:***



No, you can continue to develop with your current license(s). Your Unity 3x, 4x and 5x licenses are yours to develop with for as long as you wish. Unity 5 Pro perpetual licenses will not be supported with new features, fixes and improvements after March 3, 2017 however. This means that you can continue to use the license, but bug fixes and new features will not be available after this time.



We will contact our perpetual customers with an offer to switch to the new subscription.
