**Symptoms**


- I received a voucher/ discount coupon from Unity, for example Essentials Pack or a license trial
- I follow the link in my email to redeem the voucher, but then get an error, for example "code invalid"
- My voucher does not work.



**Cause**



If the billing information in your Unity Organization is not fully filled out, the voucher cannot be added to your account.



**Resolution**



Ensure your billing information is filled out and up to date and attempt to redeem the voucher again.



If you still have difficulty, [send us](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new%20) the details and the voucher code so that we can investigate.
