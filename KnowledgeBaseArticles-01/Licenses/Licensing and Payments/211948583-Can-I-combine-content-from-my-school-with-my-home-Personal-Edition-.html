        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Student: I have worked on my project at school and would like to transfer it back home so I can continue working on it from there.</li>
<li>Teacher: I would like to know if there is a way for my students to continue their projects at home.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unity allows users to import and export projects&#xA0;inside Educational versions of&#xA0;our Editor to work with Unity Personal.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, you can combine a school project done in Unity Educational versions with a Personal Edition at home.</p>
<p>You can do this by exporting the project  <em>(Assets -&gt; Export package)&#xA0;</em> from the machine you want to move from and saving the package file onto removable media (for example a USB stick), or uploading to a secure site.</p>
<p>Once you are at the personal machine you want to work on, simply transfer the project back onto the machine and import the project  <em>(Assets -&gt; Import Package)&#xA0;</em> to continue work.</p>
