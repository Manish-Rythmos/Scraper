        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to know if Unity charge a royalty or per-title fee.</li>
<li>Are there any other fees such as annual or maintenance fees that I should be aware of?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We are sometimes asked if we charge additional fees to our users while using Unity.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity does not charge any additional fees to what is already outlined in your&#xA0;order with us.</p>
<p>We&#xA0;do not charge on a per title basis and you do not pay royalties, or pay revenue share, even for games and applications made with the Personal Edition (free) version.</p>
<p>Unity also does not charge an additional annual fee, or maintenance fee for using our Editor outside of our <a href="http://unity3d.com/get-unity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a> licensing costs.</p>
