        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have purchased a subscription within the last 7 days and I have realized I do not need it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>You may not have realized that there was a 12 month commitment period and you are unable to commit to this contract.</p>
<p>It could also be that you thought that the subscription contract was on a month to month basis, and that you could cancel at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Resolutions</strong> </p>
<p>If your serial key has not yet been activated, please get in touch and we will see what we can do to help.<br></p>
<p>If your serial key has been activated, unfortunately our subscription team may not be able to cancel your license.</p>
