<ul>
<li>I have a Unity 5 Pro perpetual license</li>
<li>I use Unity Services. Ads, Analytics, Cloud Build, Collaborate, Multiplayer, and/or Performance Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unity provided Pro-level services to Unity 5 Pro perpetual license holders. This obligation ends with the conclusion of the Unity 5 cycle.<br>For the purposes of Unity Services, impacted projects are treated as if they are operated by a Unity Personal Edition license holder. Specific services are impacted as follows:-</p>
<p><em><strong>Cloud Build:</strong> </em>  reverts to Personal tier, which results in slower build times. The Personal tier includes Standard Queue: builds are queued and created in the order received, across all customers. This impacts new and existing projects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Analytics:</em> </strong>  reverts to Personal tier, which includes Core Analytics. No access to Livestream, Heatmaps or Raw Data Export for new projects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multiplayer:</em> </strong>  reverts to Personal tier. Number of included Concurrent users reverts from 200 to 20 for projects.</p>
<p><strong><em>Performance Reporting:</em> </strong>  Cannot be enabled for new projects. Data is still collected for existing projects, but is not viewable from the developer dashboard.<br>No impacts to other services.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> <br>For Pro-level services, purchase a new <a href="https://store.unity.com/products/unity-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unity Pro subscription</a>.</p>
