<ul>
<li>I would like to know if I can reduce the number of seats in my subscription plan</li>
<li>I own seats that are no longer needed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may wish to reduce your subscription seats due to employees leaving, or other changes to your work environment.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, users who hold a subscription plan cannot reduce the amount of seats linked to their plan. This is due to the contracted period that subscriptions are tied to. Once the contracted period is over, users have the option to cancel their subscription plans if they do not wish to continue using the licenses.</p>
