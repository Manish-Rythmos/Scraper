**Symptoms**


- Student: I have worked on my project at school and would like to transfer it back home so I can continue working on it from there.
- Teacher: I would like to know if there is a way for my students to continue their projects at home.



**Cause**



Unity allows users to import and export projects inside Educational versions of our Editor to work with Unity Personal.



**Resolution**



Yes, you can combine a school project done in Unity Educational versions with a Personal Edition at home.



You can do this by exporting the project  *(Assets -> Export package)* from the machine you want to move from and saving the package file onto removable media (for example a USB stick), or uploading to a secure site.



Once you are at the personal machine you want to work on, simply transfer the project back onto the machine and import the project  *(Assets -> Import Package)* to continue work.
