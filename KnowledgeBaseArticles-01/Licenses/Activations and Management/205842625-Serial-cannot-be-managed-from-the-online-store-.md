- I am trying to add my license to my account on the Unity Online Store
- I receive this error:



![](/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203373139/Untitledkb_artical.png)



**Cause**



Educational licenses have added security features. This means that they cannot be managed through the Online Store and need to be managed through us.



**Resolution**



To make changes to your license, for example adding activations or upgrading you will need to contact sales [here.](http://unity3d.com/sales/finder)



To return activations on your license, you can get in touch with Support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).
