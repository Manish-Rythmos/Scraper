        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have just installed Windows 10 on my computer.</li>
<li>I just updated my Operating System</li>
<li>On opening Unity, I receive an error and it will not activate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, sometimes our licenses are confused by a change in OS - essentially, it tricks the license file into thinking it is being activated on a new machine, which can cause problems if you have already maxed out your activations.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Please follow this process:</p>
<p>1) Uninstall Unity</p>
<p>2) Delete this file:</p>
<p>* Windows: C:ProgramData/Unity (If the files are hidden, you need to click View and tick the Hidden Items check box.)<br></p>
<p>* Mac: Library/Application Support/Unity</p>
<p>3) Restart</p>
<p> 4) Download Unity again from our <a href="http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a><br></p>
<p> 5) Reinstall, remembering to select &#x2018;activate free version&#x2019; when prompted for Personal, or enter your serial number for Plus or Pro.</p>
