        <p>&#xA0; <strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to know which machines are activated on my license.</li>
<li>I am receiving the error message &quot;Serial exceeds the maximum number of activations&quot; but I don&apos;t know where the license is activated.&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>It can difficult to keep track on where your licenses are activated, especially if you have a large team. </p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, at this time it is not possible to view which machines are activated on your licenses via your online account. We recommend that when you initially start using Unity create a document to keep track of which machines the licenses are attached to.</p>
<p>If you need a specific computer returned you can get in contact with us and&#xA0;we can do this for you.&#xA0;You can do this by getting in touch via Support <a href="mailto:support@unity3d.com">here</a></p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>If you have a very large amount of activations we may not be able to send you&#xA0;a list of them all. However, if you need them reset, please follow the instructions in the following article <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/205056069-How-do-I-return-the-activations-on-my-Pro-Plus-license-">here</a>. </p>
