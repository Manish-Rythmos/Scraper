        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When I try to return my activations through the Unity Editor, I receive the error, &quot;Unity License return request has timed out. Please verify that you are connected to the Internet and/or try again later.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> <br>If you have accents or other special characters in your computer name, this can prevent Unity from managing the activations properly.<br></p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Check your computer name for any accents or characters that are not letters/numbers and change them. You should then be able to return your activations through the <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/205056069-How-do-I-return-the-activations-on-my-Pro-Plus-license-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">usual process</a>.&#xA0; <br></p>
