</ul>

<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Educational licenses have added security features. This means that they cannot be managed through the Online Store and need to be managed through us.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To make changes to your license, for example adding activations or upgrading you will need to contact sales <a href="http://unity3d.com/sales/finder" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>To return activations on your license, you can get in touch with Support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
