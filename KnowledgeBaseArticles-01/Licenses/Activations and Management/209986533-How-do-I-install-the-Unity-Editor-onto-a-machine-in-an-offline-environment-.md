**Symptoms**


- I would like to install the Unity Editor onto a machine in an offline environment
- I would like to install Unity without using the Installer



**Cause**



Our usual Installer requires you to be online, so will not work if you are in an offline environment.



**Resolution**



The Editor and Build modules can be downloaded separately, however the pages where these separate components are downloaded from are not currently available on our website.



*Note: The support team will be able to provide you with a link to the component download page for a specific version of Unity. Email the support team via [support@unity3d.com](mailto:support@unity3d.com)*



We have planned to add these components to the Download Archive in our Road Map. This article will be updated when this is implemented.
