**Symptoms**


- When I try to return my activations through the Unity Editor, I receive the error, "Unity License return request has timed out. Please verify that you are connected to the Internet and/or try again later."



**Cause** 
If you have accents or other special characters in your computer name, this can prevent Unity from managing the activations properly.



**Resolution**



Check your computer name for any accents or characters that are not letters/numbers and change them. You should then be able to return your activations through the [usual process](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/205056069-How-do-I-return-the-activations-on-my-Pro-Plus-license-).
