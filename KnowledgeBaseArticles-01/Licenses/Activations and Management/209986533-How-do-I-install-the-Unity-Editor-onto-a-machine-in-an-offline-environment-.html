        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to install the Unity Editor onto a machine in an offline environment</li>
<li>I would like to install Unity without using the Installer</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Our usual Installer requires you to be online, so will not work if you are in an offline environment.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The Editor and Build modules can be downloaded separately, however the pages where these separate components are downloaded from are not currently&#xA0;available on our website.</p>
<p><em>Note: The support team will be able to provide&#xA0;you with a link to the component download page for a specific version of Unity. Email the support team via <a href="mailto:support@unity3d.com" target="_blank">support@unity3d.com</a></em> </p>
<p>We have planned&#xA0;to add these components to the Download Archive in our Road Map. This article will be updated when this is implemented.</p>
