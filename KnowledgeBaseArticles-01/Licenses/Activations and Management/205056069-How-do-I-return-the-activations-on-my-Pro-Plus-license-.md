**Symptoms**


- I have used the available activations on my Pro/Plus license
- I would like to activate on a new machine, but have run out of activations
- I would like to return my old activations



**Cause**



Each Unity Pro or Plus license has a set amount of activations. If you wish to activate on a new machine and have already used your allowed activations, you can return the activations to free up the license.



**Resolution**



There are different solutions, depending on your situation.



***If you do not have access to the machine:***



If you no longer have access to the machine that your license was activated on, you can return activations made in Unity 4.5 and higher via your Web Store account.



Go [here](https://store.unity3d.com/account/licenses) for licenses purchased before 28th June 2016, otherwise follow these steps:


1. Sign in [here](https://id.unity.com).
2. Go to the "My Seats" tab
3. Under the "Activation" box, you will see how many activations you have used.
4. Click the "Remove all my activations" button to clear the license![Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_13.01.56.png](/hc/article_attachments/115006593746/Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_13.01.56.png)
5. The license is now free to be used on different machines.



***I have access to the machine:***



If you have access to the machine that the activation is on, users activated in versions higher than Unity 4.5 can users can return their licences within the Editor:


1. Open Unity
2. Click “Unity” (or Windows user click “Help”)
3. Click "Manage Licence..."
4. Click "Return Licence"



This must be done prior to reformatting or a hardware change. You must also have an uninterrupted connection to the license server.



This does not tend to be the case when behind a proxy, or if you are without Internet connection.



***3.x license holders:***



If you are a 3.x license owner, you will need to contact us directly [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new) and provide your serial number.
