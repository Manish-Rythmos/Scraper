**Symptoms**


- I have a Unity License, and want to know where and how I am able to view it.
- I would like to know where I can access and manage my Unity License information.



**Cause**



You are a Unity License holder and would like to know how you can see your own licenses for managing your activations, or further purchases.



**Resolution**



You are able to see the licenses you have purchased when logged into the Unity Online Store with your Unity credentials.



You can see a list of your subscriptions listed under 'My Account' - ['My Seats'](https://id.unity.com/subscriptions).



**More Information**



Please note that Unity Pro perpetual licenses are still managed via the legacy account system. Customers should use the same username and password for both their legacy and new Unity ID accounts. To see and manage your Unity licenses purchased before June 28th 2016, please use this [page](https://store.unity3d.com/en/account/licenses).
