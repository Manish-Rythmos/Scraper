        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am unable to customize the Splash Screen when building to Android and iOS devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This&#xA0;is caused when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The iOS Pro add-on is not attached to the serial number activated in your Unity Editor.</li>
<li>The Android Pro add-on is not attached to the serial number activated in your Unity Editor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You can now (as of June 28th 2016) purchase a new license with Android and iOS included on our <a href="https://store.unity.com/" target="_blank">Store</a> site. For older licenses that have not yet been migrated to the new licensing plan, please see below.</p>
<p>Check if the serial number activated in your Editor has the Pro Android and/or iOS Pro add-on attached. You can do this by following this process:</p>
<p>&#xA0; 1. Open the Unity Editor.</p>
<p>&#xA0; 2. Click &quot;Unity&quot; &gt; &quot;About Unity&quot; (&quot;Help&quot; &gt; &quot;About Unity&quot; on Windows).</p>
<p>This window will display the serial number, along with the features attached. See &#xA0; the example below:</p>

<p>In this case, you can purchase a new license, or migrate your old license to the new licensing system. For more information on migration, please see this <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/208592536" target="_blank">article</a>.</p>
