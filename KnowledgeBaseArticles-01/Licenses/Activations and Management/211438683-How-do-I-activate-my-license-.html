        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have not used Unity before and would like to know how to activate my license</li>
<li>I would like to activate Personal, Plus, or Pro</li>
<li>I have used Unity Personal, but would like to update the Editor to my new Plus or Pro license.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to activate, depending on your network situation.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The fastest way to activate is online. Guidance for this can be found <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OnlineActivationGuide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>If you are in a secure network environment, or receive an error while activating, it may be due to a connectivity problem. Please try <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manually Activating</a>. If this does not work for you, please send the details along with screenshots of any errors received to <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have used Unity Personal, or a different Pro/Plus license key, in the past you need to update your Editor to input your new license details. To do this, please follow this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Unity Editor as usual</li>
<li>Sign in with your Unity account</li>
<li>Press the &apos;Unity&apos; button (or &apos;Help&apos; if you are on a Windows machine)</li>
<li>Press &apos;Manage License&apos;</li>
<li>Select &apos;Activate new license&apos; and type in your new Unity serial number.</li>
</ol>
