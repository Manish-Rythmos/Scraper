**Symptoms**


- I am trying to activate Unity and I am getting a error stating I have no network connection
- My PC is behind a proxy



**Cause**



You are unable to open the Unity Editor and activate your version of Unity because you can see this error screen:

This error may occur due to the following:


- Your network connection is running behind a firewall, proxy or anti-viral software. This can block the connection to our servers.
- You have a weak or intermittent Internet connection.



**Resolution**



Initially, click the face icon in the top right and select 'Work Offline'.



If this does not work, you need to perform a manual activation.



1. Unplug your machine from the Internet
2. Run Unity and you will be prompted to initiate the manual activation process.
3. Follow these steps [here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html).
