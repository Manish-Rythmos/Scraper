        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have used the available activations on my Pro/Plus license</li>
<li>I would like to activate on a new machine, but have run out of activations</li>
<li>I would like to return my old activations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Each Unity Pro or Plus license has a set amount of activations. If you wish to activate on a new machine and have already used your allowed activations, you can return the activations to free up the license.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>There are different solutions, depending on your situation.</p>
<p><strong><em>If you do not&#xA0;have access to the machine:</em> </strong> </p>
<p>If you no longer have access to the machine that your license was activated on, you can return activations made in Unity 4.5 and higher via your Web Store account.</p>
<p>Go <a href="https://store.unity3d.com/account/licenses" target="_blank">here</a> for licenses purchased before 28th June 2016, otherwise follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in <a href="https://id.unity.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Go to the &quot;My Seats&quot; tab</li>
<li>Under the &quot;Activation&quot; box, you will see how many activations you have used.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Remove all my activations&quot; button to clear the license<img src="/hc/article_attachments/115006593746/Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_13.01.56.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2017-04-27_at_13.01.56.png"></li>
<li>The license is now free to be used on different machines.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>I have access to the machine:</em> </strong> </p>
<p>If you have access to the machine that the activation is on, users activated in versions higher than Unity 4.5 can users can return their licences within the Editor:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Unity</li>
<li>Click &#x201C;Unity&#x201D; (or Windows user click &#x201C;Help&#x201D;)</li>
<li>Click &quot;Manage Licence...&quot;</li>
<li>Click &quot;Return Licence&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>This must be done prior to reformatting or a hardware change. You must also have an uninterrupted connection to the license server.</p>
<p>This does not tend to be the case when behind a proxy, or if you are without Internet connection.</p>
