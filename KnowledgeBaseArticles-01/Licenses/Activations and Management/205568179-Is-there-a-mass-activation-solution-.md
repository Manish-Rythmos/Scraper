**Symptoms**


- I work in an educational institution
- I have many computers to activate
- I am looking for a way to activate all my machines at once.



**Cause**



If you have a full lab of machines to activate, obviously you would like to save as much time as possible. We do not yet have a mass activation option, but silent command line activation is the fastest way to activate multiple machines.



**Resolutions**



At the moment, we do not support activation through imaging software, so the fastest way to activate multiple machines is to use Command Line/ Terminal.



Please see the link[ here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html) for guidance.



*Please note, in theÂ command line argument:*



***"C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe" -quit -batchmode -serial <serial #> -username <account username> -password <password>"***



*The account username is the email address, not the real username.*



**More Information**



If you wish to return activations on your Educational License, or would like more information about Command Line activation, you can contact us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).
