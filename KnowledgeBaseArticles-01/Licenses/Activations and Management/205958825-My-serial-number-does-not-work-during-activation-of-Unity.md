**Symptoms**


- I am getting the error message  *"Your serial number is invalid"*
- I am getting the error message  *"Serial has reached the* 
*maximum number of activations. Disable existing activations to reuse this* 
*serial key"*
- I have recently updated to Windows 10 and I am now getting the error message:  *"There was a problem validating the license because the operating system identification seems to have changed"*



**Cause**



***If you are receiving the error, "Your serial number is invalid," or "Serial has reached the  maximum number of activations. Disable existing activations to reuse this serial key" :***



This means you have reached the activation limit for your license and you would need to return activation's on the license to your online account.



Each  *Standard*  Unity license allows a single person to use Unity on  *two*  machines that they have exclusive use of.



Each Student of Faculty *Educational*  Unity license allows a single person to use Unity on  *one*  machine that they have exclusive use of.



***If you are receiving the error, "There was a problem validating the license because the operating system identification seems to have changed":***



If you have migrated to another machine, re-imaged your current machine, or your machine has malfunctioned and you have not returned activations on your license, you will receive an error when you try to activate Unity. If this happens, you will need to contact Support to reset your activations manually.
