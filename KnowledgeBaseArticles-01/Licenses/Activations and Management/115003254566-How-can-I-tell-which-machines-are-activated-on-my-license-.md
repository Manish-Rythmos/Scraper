**Symptoms**


- I would like to know which machines are activated on my license.
- I am receiving the error message "Serial exceeds the maximum number of activations" but I don't know where the license is activated.



**Cause**



It can difficult to keep track on where your licenses are activated, especially if you have a large team.



**Resolution**



Unfortunately, at this time it is not possible to view which machines are activated on your licenses via your online account. We recommend that when you initially start using Unity create a document to keep track of which machines the licenses are attached to.



If you need a specific computer returned you can get in contact with us and we can do this for you. You can do this by getting in touch via Support [here](mailto:support@unity3d.com)



**More Information**



If you have a very large amount of activations we may not be able to send you a list of them all. However, if you need them reset, please follow the instructions in the following article [here](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/205056069-How-do-I-return-the-activations-on-my-Pro-Plus-license-).
