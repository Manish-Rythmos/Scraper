        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>You have created a new project and wish to enable Unity Collaborate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may not be able to find the Collaborate option under the Services tab, as this Service is currently only available in Unity 5.5 and later.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  Once activated in Unity 5.5 or later, open up the Services tab and enable the Collaborate Service</p>
<p>This will create a new project in the Organisation that your project is currently enabled with.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  When changes are made to the project you should see the  <em>Collab</em>  button change as shown in the screenshot below.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong>  Clicking this button will show you a commit message box and a list of the assets that have been changed.</p>

<p>Your Project will now be set-up, ready for other team members to pull from the Cloud.&#xA0;</p>
