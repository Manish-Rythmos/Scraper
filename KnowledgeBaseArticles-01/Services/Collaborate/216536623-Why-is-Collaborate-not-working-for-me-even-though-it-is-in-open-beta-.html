        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a project owner and my other teammates are able to use Unity Collaborate, but I am not able to. </li>
<li>I am trying to push a build on Collaborate, but am still unable to see the &#x201C;Collab&#x201D; button in the Editor after logging out and logging back in. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may still be using an older version of Unity. You and your Unity Organization may also not have been properly whitelisted.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>It is possible that you are using Unity 5.4. Please note that Collaborate Open Beta is only available in 5.5. </p>
<p>To join the Beta, go to the <a href="https://unity3d.com/services/collaborate" target="_blank">Collaborate home page</a> and click &apos;Join now&apos;.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>We recommend using the most recent version, but if you need access to Unity Collaborate in 5.4, please <a href="mailto:collabsupport@unity3d.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>
