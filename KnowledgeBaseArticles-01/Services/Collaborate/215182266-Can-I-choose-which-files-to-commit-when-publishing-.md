**Symptoms**


- I use Unity Collaborate and would like to know if it is possible to choose what file to commit.

You would like to know if you are able to select which file to commit for publishing.



**Resolution**



Selecting which file to commit for publishing is not currently possible, but it is being worked on in a preview build on 5.5+.
