        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I recently committed a change and would like to remove it.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You made a recent change to your build, but would like to now remove it or roll it back.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>At this time, we unfortunately do not have a feature for rolling back commits. This feature is in development however and we expect to have it in a later Unity version preview build.</p>
<p>The build will be available <a href="http://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/collaborate" target="_blank">here</a> once it is ready.</p>
