        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to add members of my team to my Unity Collaborate project.</li>
<li>I don&apos;t know how to share my project with the members of my organization.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to add users to your Collaborate project.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>There are multiple ways that you can start collaborating with your teammates.</p>
<p>First, you will need to ensure that you are <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206494363?flash_digest=5b70b4cd427b7454a65b034ae07430f363d9599c" target="_blank">added to the organization</a> that the project was created under. If you are already added, ensure that you are a Manager (or Owner) for that organization.</p>
<p>If you want someone to have access to all of your organization&apos;s projects that are currently on Collaborate, make them an Owner or Manager of the organization. When they open the Unity Editor, they will see an  <strong>In The Cloud</strong> &#xA0;option for opening projects.</p>

<p>This option is not viable for all users. If you just want someone to have access to particular projects, not all of them, you can use the&#xA0; <strong>Invite Teammate</strong> &#xA0;option found in the Collaborate panel in the Editor.</p>
<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/115001480426/Screen_Shot_2017-01-30_at_10.17.45.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You will then be able to enter the email address of the user you&apos;d like to add to the project.</p>

<p>Now your teammates will have access to the project. They can download it via the Collaborate panel, and push their changes as they work on the project.</p>
