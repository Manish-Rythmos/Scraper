**Symptoms**


- I recently committed a change and would like to remove it.



**Cause**



You made a recent change to your build, but would like to now remove it or roll it back.



**Resolution**



At this time, we unfortunately do not have a feature for rolling back commits. This feature is in development however and we expect to have it in a later Unity version preview build.



The build will be available [here](http://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/collaborate) once it is ready.
