**Symptoms**


- I am a mobile game developer and am interested in using Unity Ads to generate revenue for my apps.



**Cause**



You may be unsure how to make a Unity Ads account in order to monetize your game.



**Resolution**



***If you are are new to Unity Ads*** , or are using 5.2 or later, you will be directed to use the [new Unity Ads dashboard](http://dashboard.unityads.unity3d.com/). There you can create and edit projects and ad placements.



**More Information**



***If you have an existing Unity Ads account***  with game profiles under the [legacy Unity Ads admin](http://unityads.unity3d.com/admin), you can continue to use the old admin to manage your games profiles. If however, these game profiles are currently being used for monetization, they will be migrated to the [new Unity Ads Dashboard](http://dashboard.unityads.unity3d.com/).



***If you are an advertiser*** looking to acquire new users through Unity Ads, you will need to continue using the [legacy Unity Ads admin](http://unityads.unity3d.com/admin) to setup game profiles and run video ad campaigns.
