**Symptoms**


- I'm filling out an invoice for my Ads payment request and I'm unsure what to use as the invoice number.



**Cause**



It can be a little confusing to figure out what information you should add when constructing your invoice for the first time.



**Resolution**



The invoice number is determined by you.



If it is your first Unity Ads payment request, you can use "0000001" if you like, for example.



If you are part of a company, you may wish to speak with your finance team in order to find out what the invoice number should be.
