        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am trying to integrate Unity Ads into my project.</li>
<li>I have enabled Unity Ads but I am still getting the error &quot;&apos;Advertisements&apos; does not exist in the namespace &apos;UnityEngine&apos;&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You are building for a platform that is not supported by Unity Ads or you haven&apos;t enabled Ads for your project yet.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure Ads is toggled  <strong>ON</strong>  in the Services window.</li>
<li>Unity Ads is only supported on iOS and Android, so you should select iOS or Android as a build target.</li>
<li>If your project is meant to be built for platforms other than iOS and Android, you could add a UNITY_ADS&#xA0;<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Advertisements.Advertisement.Show.html">conditional define</a>.&#xA0;This means that building with Unity Ads will not affect other platforms.</li>
</ul>
