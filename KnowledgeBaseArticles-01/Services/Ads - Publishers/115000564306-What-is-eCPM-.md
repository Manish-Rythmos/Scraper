**Resolution**



**eCPM***(effective Cost Per Mille)*  is the amount you earn per 1000 impressions. The value is determined by the bids of the adverts that are shown in your game and the overall performance.



If the ads in your game perform well - you will have a good eCPM. If your eCPM is low - consider reviewing your integration design and spreading your game to other countries.



*Tip: If you wish to predict possible earnings then it is best to use the average revenue earned per "daily active users (ARPDAU) as it is a more accurate and useful performance indicator.*
