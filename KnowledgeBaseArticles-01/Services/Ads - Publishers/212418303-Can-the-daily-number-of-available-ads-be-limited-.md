**Symptoms**


- I have implemented Unity Ads into my game and would like to change the amount of video ads shown in it.



**Cause**



Users are limited by default to 25 ads per day (on a rolling 24 hour basis) per app. Users are also limited to seeing the same ad only once per hour.



**Resolution**



Yes. Please contact [unityads-support@unity3d.com](mailto:unityads-support@unity3d.com) and we will configure this for you.
