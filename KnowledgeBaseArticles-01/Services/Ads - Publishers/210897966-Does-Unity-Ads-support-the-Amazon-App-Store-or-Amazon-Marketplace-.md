**Symptoms**


- I want to know if Unity Ads is supported on the Amazon App Store.



**Cause**



You need to know if the Amazon App Store that you are targeting supports our Unity Ads service.



**Resolution**



No, Unity Ads does not currently support the Amazon App Store, or Amazon Marketplace, for downloadable Android Games.



You can implement Unity Ads in Android games downloaded through Amazon. All of our campaigns however, are currently advertising apps in the Google Play store. Ad impressions will not generate revenue unless the user also has access to the Google Play store.



We are exploring the possibility of expanding our network to include Amazon.
