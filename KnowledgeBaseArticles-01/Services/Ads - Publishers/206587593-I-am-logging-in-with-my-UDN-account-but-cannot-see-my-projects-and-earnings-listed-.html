        
<p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have been instructed by the front page of Ads to sign in with my main Unity Developer Account (UDN)</li>
<li>I cannot see my projects and earnings listed as I have in the past</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>As of November 2015, Unity Ads is now linked to your main Unity account, rather than on a separate account. Since the switch, a few users have experienced their projects disappearing from the list in Ads and the earning information is also missing.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Please ensure that you are signing in with the correct email address for your Unity account, rather than your Unity Ads login.</p>
<p>If you need to check which email address is the correct one to use, please <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new%20" target="_blank">get in touch</a> with us, including your Developer ID in the message and we will look up your account.</p>
