**Symptoms**


- I would like to configure reports to be sent to me at certain intervals - how can I do this?



**Cause**



Reports can be configured through the Automated Reports option.



**Resolution**



Go to  **Statistics**  >  **Configure Automated Report > Add Report**  to configure the report, set how often you want to receive the reports, which metrics to split by and enter the email address (or addresses, separated by commas) you want reports sent to - see the screenshot below for an example.
