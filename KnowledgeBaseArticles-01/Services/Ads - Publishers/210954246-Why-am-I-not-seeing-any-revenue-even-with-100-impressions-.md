**Symptoms**


- I use Unity Ads to generate revenue for my game.
- I see that there are impressions reported, but no revenue for those impressions.



**Cause**



It will take typically 5,000 impressions to determine the quality of users.



**Resolution**



Typically it takes 5,000 impressions or more to determine the quality of the users you are sending. You will be getting revenue based on the quality of your users and the impressions you are showing.



**More Information**



Revenue is generated based on a combination of views, clicks, and installs. There's no one unified way of pre-calculating the revenue generated by your game as we run a wide variety of campaigns on our platform. Over time, we optimize your game's ads to improve ad targetingÂ and increase your revenue.
