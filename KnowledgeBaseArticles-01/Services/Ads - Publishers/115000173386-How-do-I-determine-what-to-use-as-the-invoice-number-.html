        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I&apos;m filling out an invoice for my Ads payment request and I&apos;m unsure what to use as the invoice number.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>It can be a little confusing to figure out what information you should add when constructing your invoice for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The invoice number is determined by you.</p>
<p>If it is your first Unity Ads payment request, you can use &quot;0000001&quot; if you like, for example.</p>
<p>If you are part of a company, you may wish to speak with your finance team in order to find out what the invoice number should be.</p>
