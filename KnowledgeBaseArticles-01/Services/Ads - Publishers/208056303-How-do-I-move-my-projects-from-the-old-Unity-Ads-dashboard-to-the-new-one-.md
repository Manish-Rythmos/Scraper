**Symptoms**


- I am a publisher using Unity Ads in my apps to generate revenue
- I wish to transfer my projects to the new in-browser Unity Services Dashboard



**Cause**



We are currently migrating all Unity Ads user accounts to the Unity Developer Network (UDN). This may cause some confusion with which account to use in the Dashboard.



**Resolution**



To continue using the old Unity Ads admin, you will need login using your UDN account instead of the old Unity Ads login.



We are planning to begin migrating all games from the old Unity Ads admin to the new in-browser Unity Services Dashboard in early 2016. Barring any issues, you should see them all in the new Dashboard by the end of Spring 2016.



Please keep in mind that when they are transferred, each game profile will appear as its own project in the new Dashboard.



We will be working on a way to merge projects, or re-associate the platforms (game IDs) of multiple projects under a single project, but this option will not be available right away.
