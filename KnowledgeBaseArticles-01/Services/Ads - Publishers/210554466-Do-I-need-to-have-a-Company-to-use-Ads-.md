**Symptoms**


- I do not have a Company/ I am not a member of a Company, but would like to use Unity Ads
- I am an independent Developer and would like to use Ads



**Cause**



During sign up, there is a field for 'Company' and 'VAT number'.



**Resolution**



At Unity, we welcome and encourage independent developers to register with our network. You do not need a have a Company to get started. When asked to enter a Company name during sign up, simply enter your own name instead.



As for VAT, you are only required to enter a VAT number if you currently have one. If you do not have a VAT number, simply enter "none" in the field when prompted.
