        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have submitted an invoice to receive my earnings. Is is possible for the earnings to be addressed to me as opposed to&#xA0;a company?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You are interested in having the earnings to go to a private person and not a company and would like to know what information should be included.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, we can pay you. However, we handle private persons a bit differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>When asked to enter a company name, simply enter your own name instead.</li>
<li>As for VAT, European Union members are only required to enter a VAT number if they currently have one. If you are a European Union member, you do not need to apply for a VAT number to use Unity Ads. If you do not have a VAT number, simply enter &quot;none&quot; in the field when prompted.</li>
</ul>
