**Symptoms**


- I am using Unity Ads to monetize my game and have noticed that, while the game is being played by users, there are no changes in the statistics. How can this be?



**Cause**



Your game may still have test mode enabled.



**Resolution**



If you do not see any ad requests, your game may still have test mode enabled.



Test mode can be disabled in your Unity Ads dashboard - see our [step-by-stepÂ guide to disabling test mode](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/213080523).



**More Information**



You should also ensure that you are initializing ads with the correct game ID.



The statistics you really want to see changes in are  **ad requests** ,  **starts** , and  **views** . It's possible that impressions, eCPM, and revenue could be static for a while.
