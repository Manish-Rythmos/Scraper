**Symptoms**


- I am interested in using Unity Ads to monetize my game and would like to know how much money I may potentially earn by using this service.



**Cause**



You would like to know the potential revenue you may make by using Unity Ads for your game.



**Resolution**



The revenue for your game depends on many factors - which platform you are on (iOS or Android), from which country your players are from, what kind of placements you do, etc., but most important is the number of players you have.



Typically the revenue delivered per 1000 video starts is between \$6-12 USD, depending on the country.
