**Symptoms**


- I use Unity Ads to monetize my game and am preparing my invoice for submission. I need to include my Developer ID - where can I find it?



**Cause**



You are preparing an invoice and need your Developer ID to submit along with the rest of your information to ensure a timely payment process.



**Resolution**



Once you log in to the dashboard with your UDN account, the Developer ID can be found under  **Invoicing** .
