        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I use Unity Ads for my game and see that my game has impressions, but 0 ad requests. How can this be?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Ad requests are a sampled value.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, it is possible to have impressions, but 0 ad requests. </p>
<p>Impressions are counted each time a video is started. Only every 23rd ad request is recorded due to sampling. If you have only a handful of ad requests per day, only every 13th of them is added to the statistics.</p>
