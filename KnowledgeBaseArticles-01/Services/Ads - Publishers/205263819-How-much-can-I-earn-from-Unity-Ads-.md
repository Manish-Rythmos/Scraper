**Symptoms**


- I am a publisher using Unity Ads in my apps to generate revenue
- I wish to know how much I can expect to earn



**Cause**



Publishers based in different countries can earn a range of amounts. This is because there are different amounts of ads available in different countries. The more ads your particular country has, the more you can potentially earn.



**Resolution**



The average eCPM for Unity Ads ranges from \$6 - \$12. It can be as high as \$20 in English speaking countries, or as low as \$3 in non-English speaking countries. Revenue is based on the quality of impressions.
