**Symptoms**


- I use Unity Ads and would like to know how I can receive payments from the revenue my game has generated.



**Cause**



You would like to know how you can receive the earnings from your game.



**Resolution**



Unity Ads currently only offers payments by wire transfer. To request payment, you must submit an [invoice](https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/Invoice_example-UnityAds.xlsx) to [accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com](mailto:accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com). The minimum earnings balance required to submit an invoice is \$100 USD.



When you submit an invoice for the first time, you need to include your bank account information using the [bank information form](https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/WireTransferForm-UnityAds.pdf).



**More Information**



Please see the [payment request documentation](https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/PaymentRequest-UnityAds.pdf) for more details.
