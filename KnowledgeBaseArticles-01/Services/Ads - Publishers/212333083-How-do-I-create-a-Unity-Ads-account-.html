        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a mobile game developer and am interested in using Unity Ads to generate revenue for my apps.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may be unsure how to make a Unity Ads account in order to monetize your game.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><em><strong>If you are are new to Unity Ads</strong> </em> , or are using 5.2 or later, you will be directed to use the&#xA0;<a href="http://dashboard.unityads.unity3d.com/">new Unity Ads dashboard</a>.&#xA0;There you can create and edit projects and ad placements.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p><em><strong>If you have an existing Unity Ads account</strong> </em>  with game profiles under the&#xA0;<a href="http://unityads.unity3d.com/admin">legacy Unity Ads admin</a>, you can continue to use the old admin to manage your games profiles. If however, these game profiles are currently being used for monetization, they will be migrated to the&#xA0;<a href="http://dashboard.unityads.unity3d.com/">new Unity Ads Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>If you are an advertiser</strong>  </em> looking to acquire new users through Unity Ads, you will need to continue using the&#xA0;<a href="http://unityads.unity3d.com/admin">legacy Unity Ads admin</a>&#xA0;to setup game profiles and run video ad campaigns.</p>
