        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a game developer and am using Unity Ads to monetize my game. Video ads are either not being shown or are buffering. What can I do to fix&#xA0;this?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Buffering and timeouts of video ads may be due to connection issues.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>If you are currently using SDK 1.X then the recommended fix is to upgrade your Unity Ads integration to 2.X as we have greatly improved how we deal with&#xA0;connection handling.</p>
<p>If, however, you are experiencing this on 2.X we recommend <a href="mailto:unityads-support@unity3d.com">reaching out to our support team</a>,&#xA0;who will be able to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
