**Symptoms**


- I have submitted an invoice to receive my earnings. Is is possible for the earnings to be addressed to me as opposed toÂ a company?



**Cause**



You are interested in having the earnings to go to a private person and not a company and would like to know what information should be included.



**Resolution**



Yes, we can pay you. However, we handle private persons a bit differently:


- When asked to enter a company name, simply enter your own name instead.
- As for VAT, European Union members are only required to enter a VAT number if they currently have one. If you are a European Union member, you do not need to apply for a VAT number to use Unity Ads. If you do not have a VAT number, simply enter "none" in the field when prompted.



**More Information**



For more information about payment requests, please review the [Unity Ad revenue payment request document](https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/UnityAds_payment_request_october.pdf).
