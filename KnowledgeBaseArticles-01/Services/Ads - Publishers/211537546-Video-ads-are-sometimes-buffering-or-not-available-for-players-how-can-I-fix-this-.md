**Symptoms**


- I am a game developer and am using Unity Ads to monetize my game. Video ads are either not being shown or are buffering. What can I do to fix this?



**Cause**



Buffering and timeouts of video ads may be due to connection issues.



**Resolution**



If you are currently using SDK 1.X then the recommended fix is to upgrade your Unity Ads integration to 2.X as we have greatly improved how we deal with connection handling.



If, however, you are experiencing this on 2.X we recommend [reaching out to our support team](mailto:unityads-support@unity3d.com), who will be able to troubleshoot the issue.
