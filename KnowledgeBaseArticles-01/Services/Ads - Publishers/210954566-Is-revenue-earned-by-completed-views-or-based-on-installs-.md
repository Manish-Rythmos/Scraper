**Symptoms**


- I am interested in using Unity Ads to monetize my game and would like to know how revenue is generated.
- I use Unity Ads and want to understand what stats contribute to earned revenue.



**Cause**



Unity Ads generates revenue through generating views and traffic from your game and you get paid based on that.



**Resolution**



There is no "one unified way" of pre-calculating the revenue generated to you, as we run different types of campaigns with different billing points, including completed views, clicks, and installs.



Our algorithmÂ always selects the best possible campaigns for your users, to generate as much revenue as possible.
