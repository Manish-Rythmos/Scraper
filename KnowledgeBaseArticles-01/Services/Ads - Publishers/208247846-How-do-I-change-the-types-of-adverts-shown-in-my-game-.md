**Symptoms**


- I wish to change the types of adverts that show in my game to avoid showing adverts that my users may not like.



**Cause**



Your application is showing adverts that are not targeted towards your game's audience or you simply wish to optimize the types of adverts shown.



**Resolution**



In order to optimize the categories of adverts that your game presents to your users then follow the steps below:



1. Log in to your Unity account [here](https://unity3d.com/services/ads).



2. Go to the Unity Ads [Dashboard](https://dashboard.unityads.unity3d.com/).



3. Click on the project that you wish to edit.![](/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203508403/EditAdvertCategories_01.png)



4. Click on the platform that you wish to edit



*Note: The reason they're on the Platform level is because the categories are slightly different between platforms.*

5. Select the  ***Filtering*** tab and click the  ***Edit*** button.
