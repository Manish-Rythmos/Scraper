**Symptoms**


- I would like to implement Unity Multiplayer but need to know the costs.
- I wish to know how much I can expect to pay for this service.



**Cause**



You want to make a multiplayer game and would like to know an estimate of the cost.



**Resolution**



Unity offers a free amount of Concurrent users (CCU) for each license.



- Personal:  **20 Concurrent Users**



- Plus:  **50 Concurrent Users**



- Professional:  **200 Concurrent Users**



If you need to increase the number of CCUs that your game supports then you can set this when you submit a live request via the multiplayer dashboard. If you do this, you will be charged \$0.49/ GB of traffic that travels through the Unity infrastructure (Matchmaker, Relay Server). This means that you pay for the extra bandwidth that you use.



We also have a way to [estimate your monthly bill](https://unity3d.com/services/multiplayer). This can be found by scrolling to the bottom of the multiplayer page.



**More Information**



For more information on how the pricing system was worked out, please see the Multiplayer Development Lead's [Forum post](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-multiplayer-launch-faq-march-2016.392474/).
