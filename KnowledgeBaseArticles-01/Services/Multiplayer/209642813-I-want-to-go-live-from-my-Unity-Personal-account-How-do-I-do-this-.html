<ul>
<li>I am a Unity Personal Edition user</li>
<li>I wish to &apos;Go Live&apos; with my Unity Multiplayer game</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>As Unity Multiplayer is a new Service, initially we have set it to Go Live only through a Pro license holder&apos;s account.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>We are currently improving our backend systems to allow us to recognize Personal Edition users who have a payment instrument on file.</p>
<p>For now, if you are a Personal Edition user who wishes to Go Live with your game, please <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new%20" target="_blank">contact us</a> and we will see what we can do to help.</p>
