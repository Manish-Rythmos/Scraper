        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I&apos;m encountering errors when I build with certain versions of Xcode.</li>
<li>I&apos;m developing for iOS and Mac, and I would like to know which version of Xcode to install.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You need to know if you should have a specific version of Xcode for using Unity Cloud Build.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Generally, Unity Cloud Build uses the latest official Xcode release from Apple, as Apple usually requires apps to be built with the latest versions of Xcode for submission.</p>
<p>When new Xcode versions are released, they&apos;re tested with the Unity Cloud Build tools and then released for general use in Unity Cloud Build.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>You may encounter errors if you are using third-party plugins. Plugins need to have an updated Xcode library, so be aware of this when using the  <strong>L</strong>  <strong>atest Compatible Version</strong>  of Xcode with third-party plugins</p>
