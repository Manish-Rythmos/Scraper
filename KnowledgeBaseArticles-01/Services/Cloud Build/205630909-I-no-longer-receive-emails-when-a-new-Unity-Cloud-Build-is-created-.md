**Symptoms**


- I am the owner of the project, but I am not receiving any update emails from Cloud Build.
- All other Cloud Build collaborators are receiving emails. Why am I not?



**Causes**



It may be that you are not receiving emails due to your notifications setting being disabled.



**Resolution**



To solve this problem, you will need to enable your notification settings. You can find this setting via the following [link](https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/login/me).



If you are having problems doing this yourself, please contact Support by creating a new ticket [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).
