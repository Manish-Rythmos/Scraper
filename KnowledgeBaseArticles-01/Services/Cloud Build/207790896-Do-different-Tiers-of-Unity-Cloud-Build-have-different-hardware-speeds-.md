**Symptoms**


- I would like to try Unity Cloud Build/ I have an existing Cloud Build subscription, but am considering changing my plan
- I would like to know if the different Tiers available have different hardware speeds



**Cause**



Since the prices for the Personal, Pro, Studio and Enterprise Tiers are different, you may wonder if this means that the hardware speed is different as well.



**Resolution**



The short answer is 'No'. The hardware speed of Unity Cloud Build does not differ with the different Tiers avalable.



The speed for the different Tiers of Cloud Build is the same, though the 'cool down' time afterwards does vary. This means that after building from different Tiers, you will experience different amounts of wait time before you can build again. For example, after building in Free Tier, you need to wait 60 minutes before you can do a build. Studio on the other hand, has a 5 minute cool down time.
