        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am the owner of the project, but I am not receiving any update emails from Cloud Build.</li>
<li>All other Cloud Build collaborators are receiving emails. Why am I not?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>It may be that you are not receiving emails due to your notifications setting being disabled.<br></p>
