**Symptoms**


- I have a set usage with my Cloud Build plan and think I might go over the limit
- I am a Unity Cloud Build user and want to know what happens if I go over my usage limit



**Causes**



Each tier of Unity Cloud Build subscriptions have different repo limits, which you can view [here](https://checkout.unity.com/products/cloud-build).



**Resolutions**



Cloud Build will not create builds that are larger than the usage limit stipulated in your plan tier. If you are about to go over the limit, you will receive an error message in your build.



If you think that you are going to go over this limit, you will have to decrease the size of your project to stay within the usage limits of your current tier.



Alternatively, you can upgrade to a higher tier Cloud Build subscription plan, enabling you a greater usage limit.
