**Symptoms**


- I am an advertiser and would like to target certain genres of games to show my ads.



**Cause**



By targeting certain games, you may be able to maximize the revenue earned from your ad campaigns.



**Resolution**



Generally speaking, it is not advisable to target specific categories - many different categories have relevant users for your game, and including all categories maximizes the volume of installs you are likely to receive.



If, however, you would like to run ad campaigns on a specific category then [contact the AdOps team](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact)Â and let us know which categories you want to target - we will be able to apply that targeting before you set the campaigns live.
