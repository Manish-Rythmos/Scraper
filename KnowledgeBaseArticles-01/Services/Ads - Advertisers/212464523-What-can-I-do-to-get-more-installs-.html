        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am using Unity Ads and want to&#xA0;increase the number of views that result in an install.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You&#xA0;would like to spend the entirety of your daily budget but currently you are&#xA0;not generating enough installs.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Firstly, it is vital that your video trailer is of good quality and clearly showcases your game so that potential users can make an informed&#xA0;decision as to whether to install your game.&#xA0;We recommend running multiple videos simultaneously&#xA0;to maximise the diversity of in-game content your potential users are exposed to. We also suggest that you refresh your videos every few months if your resources permit.</p>
<p>Secondly, the number of impressions your videos receive are directly linked to your eCPM. The best way to increase your eCPM - and ultimately the number of impressions - is to try increasing your CPI bid price.</p>
