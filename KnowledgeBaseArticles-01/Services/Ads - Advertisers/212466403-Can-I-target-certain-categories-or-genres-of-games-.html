        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am an advertiser and would like to target certain genres of games to show my ads.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>By targeting certain games, you may be able to maximize the revenue earned from your ad campaigns.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is not advisable to target specific categories - many different categories have relevant users for your game, and including all categories maximizes the volume of installs you are likely to receive.</p>
<p>If, however, you would like to run ad campaigns on a specific category then <a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact">contact the AdOps team</a>&#xA0;and let us know which categories you want to target - we will be able to apply that targeting before you set the campaigns live.</p>
