**Symptoms**


- I am an advertiser and would like to prevent certain games from showing my ad campaign.



**Cause**



You would like to block certain games from showing your ads.



**Resolution**



Our system automatically optimizes towards higher quality sources for you so manual optimization isn't necessary.



Should you see a particular source that isn't performing for your campaign but still delivers high volume then [contact the AdOps team](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact), who will be able to make these changes on your behalf.



For this you will need the source ID, which can be retrieved from your tracking provider (for example AppsFlyer or Tune).
