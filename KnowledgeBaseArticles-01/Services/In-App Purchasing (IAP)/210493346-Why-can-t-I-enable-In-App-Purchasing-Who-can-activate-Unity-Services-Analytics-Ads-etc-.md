**Symptoms**


- I am unable to activate the "In App Purchasing" service.



**Cause**



You may not be an Owner or Manager of the Organization your project is managed by.



**Resolution**



IAP and other Unity Services can be enabled by an Organization's project Managers and Owners. Members with the "User" role do not have this permission. Please [contact support](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new%20) for additional help enabling IAP.
