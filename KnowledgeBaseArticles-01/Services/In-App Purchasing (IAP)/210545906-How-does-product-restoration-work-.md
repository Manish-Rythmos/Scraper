**Symptoms**


- I would like to understand how product restoration works.



**Cause**



App users on  **iOS**  need to type in their Apple password to restore purchases, it is required to provide a button to restore purchases, and a method which calls the RestoreTransactions method of the IAppleExtensions.



App users on  **Android**  will not need to do anything, Android will handle it for you automatically.



**Resolution**



You can read more about restoring transactions on iOS [here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPRestoringTransactions.html) and [here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPiOSMAS.html).Â You can also see an example method [here](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/analytics/integrating-unity-iap-your-game).
