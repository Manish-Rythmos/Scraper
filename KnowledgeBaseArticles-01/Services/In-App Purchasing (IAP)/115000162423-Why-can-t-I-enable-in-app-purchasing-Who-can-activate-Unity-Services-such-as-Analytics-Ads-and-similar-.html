        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I&apos;m trying to enable in-app purchasing in the Services window of the Unity Editor and it&apos;s not working.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>A common cause of this issue is when a member&#xA0;is not an Owner or Manager of the organization</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>IAP and other Unity Services can be enabled by an organization&apos;s project managers and owners. Members with the &quot;User&quot; role do not have this permission.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://analytics.cloud.unity3d.com/support/">contact support</a> for additional help enabling IAP.</p>
