**Resolution**



***Courseware***



Certification Courseware costs have not yet been released.



Courseware will be available for purchase soon and you can sign up to receive a notification when it is launched [here](https://certification.unity.com/courseware).



Once Courseware is available, individual Developer and Studio bundles will be available through our Website.



Educational bundles will be available through our [Sales Team](https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales). Educational institutions who wish to offer Unity Certification to their students may be eligible for discounted pricing. We do not offer a student discount.



***Exam***



Pricing for the Certification Exam will vary by region. The US retail price for the exam is \$250 and the Certification is valid for 2 years.



You can also sign up to take the Certified exam at one of our Unite events. For more information on the locations and dates available, please see [this page](https://certification.unity.com/get-certified). Paid Unite attendees will be offered a 25% discount on the Exam price.
