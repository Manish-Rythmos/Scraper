        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to access the Performance Reporting service, but I am unsure how to do this.</li>
<li>I am currently on Unity Personal and would like to know if I can access Performance Reporting<br></li>
<li>I would like to know which paid tiers currently have access to Performance Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unity currently offers a service called Performance Reporting that automatically collects application errors across devices and platforms, so that development teams can find and address issues in real time with their projects.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Access to this service is currently available to Unity Plus &amp; Unity Pro subscribers. Any users who purchased a Unity v5.x perpetual license prior to June 28th 2016 will also have access to this service. </p>
<p>Currently, there is no version of Performance Reporting available to Unity Personal users.</p>
