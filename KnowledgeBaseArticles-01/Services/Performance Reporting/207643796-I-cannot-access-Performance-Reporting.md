**Symptoms**


- I cannot access the Game Performance Reporting Service
- I am receiving a 403 error when I try to use Game Performance Reporting



**Cause**



The Unity Game Performance Reporting Service is currently available to Unity 5.x Pro license holders only. If you are a 3.x or 4.x Pro license holder, or are using Unity 5.x Personal Edition, you will not have access to this Service.



**Resolution**



If you wish to upgrade a current Pro license, or purchase a new one, you can contact Sales [here](https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales).



If you are using a Pro 5.x license and still having trouble accessing the Game Performance Reporting Service, please get in touch with Support by submitting a new ticket [here](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new%20).
