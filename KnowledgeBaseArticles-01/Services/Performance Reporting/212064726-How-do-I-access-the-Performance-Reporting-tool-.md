**Symptoms**


- I would like to access the Performance Reporting service, but I am unsure how to do this.
- I am currently on Unity Personal and would like to know if I can access Performance Reporting
- I would like to know which paid tiers currently have access to Performance Reporting



**Cause**



Unity currently offers a service called Performance Reporting that automatically collects application errors across devices and platforms, so that development teams can find and address issues in real time with their projects.



**Resolution**



Access to this service is currently available to Unity Plus & Unity Pro subscribers. Any users who purchased a Unity v5.x perpetual license prior to June 28th 2016 will also have access to this service.



Currently, there is no version of Performance Reporting available to Unity Personal users.
