        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have activated my Unity Plus subscription, but I cannot access the Performance Reporting Service</li>
<li>Performance Reporting is not working in either the Editor, or the Device, while I am on a Plus subscription.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Access to the Performance Reporting service should be granted shortly after you have activated your Unity Plus license.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Firstly, please ensure that you have enabled Performance Reporting in your Project dashboard by clicking &#x2018;Enable Game Performance&#x2019;:</p>

<p>Once this has been done, you will be taken to your dashboard. Selecting the &#x2018;Getting Started&#x2019; tab will show you the two methods of activating this Service within the Editor, depending on the version of Unity you are using.</p>
<p>If you have followed the above and are still unable to access this service with your Unity Plus license, please get in touch with Support by submitting a new ticket <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new%20" target="_blank">here</a> with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Project GUID / UPID / ID</li>
<li>The Version of Unity you are currently using</li>
<li>Whether you are using the stand-alone Plug-in or Service Integration method</li>
</ul>
