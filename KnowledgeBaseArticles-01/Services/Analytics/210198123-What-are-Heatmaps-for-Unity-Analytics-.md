**Symptoms**


- I would like to understand the Heatmaps feature for Unity Analytics



**Cause**



You may have heard about Heatmaps and wondered what they are and how they benefit you as a Game Developer.



**Resolution**



Heatmaps provide a visualization of spatial events that occur in your game.



Where do players die?



Where do they score kills?



Which roads are most traveled in your game?



By collecting the data from hundreds or even thousands of plays, you begin to assemble a large-scale picture of how your players experience your game. The patterns that emerge can help you tune your game. This means that you can improve your game economy, reduce the gameplay difficulty curve and increase the level of player enjoyment.



To start using Heatmaps in your project, you will need to enable Heatmaps in your Analytics dashboard and download the Heatmaps SDK.



Note: Heatmaps requires a Unity Pro subscription.
