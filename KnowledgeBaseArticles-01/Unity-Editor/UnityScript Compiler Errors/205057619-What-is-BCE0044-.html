        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am receiving the&#xA0;error below:</li>
</ul>
<pre>BCE0044: expecting ____, found &quot;____</pre>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The first error (&apos;expecting&apos;) is cause by a&#xA0;UnityScript&#xA0;error on line 5 of the code where the computer was expecting a closing curly bracket, but&#xA0;found nothing there. It indicates that the right closing curly bracket is missing from this line.</p>
<p>The second error (&apos;found&apos;) is caused by&#xA0;a missing opening curly bracket on line 2. The computer will consider the closing curly bracket on line 3 an unexpected token, because it has no value without its opening curly bracket.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Make sure the script is correctly structured as shown below:</p>
