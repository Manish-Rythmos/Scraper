         <strong>Symptoms</strong> &#xA0;

<ul>
<li>I have some Scripts/Assets for demos and internal tools</li>
<li>All those Scripts are included in my project when I build, even though my scenes do not reference them in my asset bundles.&#xA0; <br></li>
</ul>

 <strong>Cause</strong> 
You&#xA0;want to create a demo, prototype or internal tools. After that, you want to work on your final project, and all those scripts are included in your project when built.
&#xA0;
 <strong>Resolution</strong> 
Currently, there is not way to exclude directories from the build process, but there is a workaround:

<ul>
<li>To exclude specific scripts, you can use the macro UNITY_EDITOR at the start of your code and it will be excluded for builds.&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#if (UNITY_EDITOR) 
... your class/code ...
#endif</code></pre>


<ul>
<li>To exclude directories, you can use symlinks (symbolic links). Try putting the scripts you want to exclude in a folder outside the Assets folder and create a symlink into Resources that points to that folder, so when you want to exclude those assets, you just need to remove the symlink and then recreate it.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>OTestCode/
MyProject/Assets/TestCode &gt;&gt; OTestCode</code> <br></pre>
