**Symptoms**



The following warning is appearing in the console:


```
warning CS0414: The private field `___' is assigned but its value is never used
```


**Cause**



The  *CS0414* warning appears when a variable with the `private` access modifier is assigned with a value, but the value is not used in any of the scripts in the project.



*Note: A variable with no access modifier defined is defaulted to private.*

Here is how the warning appears in this example:


```
warning CS0414: The private field `ExampleScript.rigidbodyPlayer' is assigned but its value is never used
```


**Resolution**



The error  *CS0414* is resolved by using the variable with the `private` access modifier in the script, or by deleting it entirely.
