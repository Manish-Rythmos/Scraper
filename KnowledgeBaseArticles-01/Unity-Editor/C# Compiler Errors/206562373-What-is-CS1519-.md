**Symptoms**



When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS1519: Unexpected symbol `__' in class struct, or interface member declaration
```


**Cause**



The  *CS1519*  error is caused when a token is in a location that it does not belong. Below is an example of two causes of the error:

Errors displayed in this example:


```
error CS1519: Unexpected symbol `j' in class struct, or interface member declaration.
```

```
error CS1519: Unexpected symbol `Name' in class struct, or interface member declaration.
```


**Resolution**



To fix the  *CS1519*  error you will need to ensure that there is only one user defined identifier for each method, class or variable declaration. If you are declaring multiple variables of the same type then ensure they are separated using commas.
