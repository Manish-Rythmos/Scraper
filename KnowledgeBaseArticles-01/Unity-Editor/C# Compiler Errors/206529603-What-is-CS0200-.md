**Symptoms**



When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS0200: Property or indexer `__' cannot be assigned to (it is read only)
```


**Cause**



The  *CS0200*  error is caused when you try to assign a value to a variable that can only be read and not changed.

Error displayed in this example:


```
error CS0200: Property or indexer `UnityEngine.GameObject.activeSelf' cannot be assigned to (it is read only)
```


**Resolution**



To fix the  *CS0200*  error you will need to find an alternative way of achieving the desired result. In this example we have a method that allows us to set the game object as active.
