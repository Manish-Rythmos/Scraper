<li>I am getting the error below appearing in my console:</li>
</ul>
<pre>NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an <br>object</pre>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This error is caused when an object&#xA0;is trying to be used by a script but does not refer to an instance of an object.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To fix this example we can acquire a reference to an instance of the script using <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.Find.html" target="_blank">GameObject.Find</a> to find the object it is attached to. We then use <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html" target="_blank">GetComponent</a> to find the script component we want a reference to.</p>

<p>You can also double click the error to take you to the line of script where the error is occurring.</p>
<p>From there you can trace each object back to where they are assigned (if they have been assigned).</p>
