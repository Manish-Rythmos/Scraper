**Symptoms**


- You try to access a member of a type (variable, method, etc.) and you get the error:


```
error CS0117: `________' does not contain a definition for `________'
```


**Cause**



This happensÂ when a reference is made to a member that does not exist for the data type.

Error presented in this example:


```
error CS0117: `UnityEngine.PlayerPrefs' does not contain a definition for `SaveGame'
```


**Resolution**



Look inside the definition of a type to check if the member exists and use that member as a reference.
