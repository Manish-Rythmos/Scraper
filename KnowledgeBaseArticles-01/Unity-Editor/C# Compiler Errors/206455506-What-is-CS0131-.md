**Symptoms**



When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS0131: The left-hand side of an assignment must be a variable, a property or an indexer
```


**Cause**



The  *CS0131* error is caused when the  **=** assignment operator does not have a variable, property or indexer to the left hand side of it.

Here is how the error appears in this example:


```

```


**Resolution**



The error  *CS0131* is resolved by adding a variable, property or indexer to the left hand side of the  **=**  assignment operator.
