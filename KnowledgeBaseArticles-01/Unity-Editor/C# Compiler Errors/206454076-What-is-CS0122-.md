**Symptoms**



When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS0122: `___' is inaccessible due to it's protection level public
```


**Cause**



The  *CS0122*  error is caused when a member without the `public`access modifier applied is invoked from another script.



In this example we have created a private method and attempted to invoke it after checking the value of a private variable.

Here is how the errors appear in this example:


```
error CS0122: `PrivateMethodScripts.dragonsSpawned' is inaccessible due to its protection levelerror CS0122: `PrivateMethodScripts.SpawnDragons()' is inaccessible due to it's protection level
```


**Resolution**



The error  *CS0122*  is resolved by changing the member's access modifier to `public`.
