**Symptoms**


- When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS1061: Type `__' does not contain a definition for `__' and no extension method `__' of type `__' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```


**Cause**



The  *CS1061* error is caused when you try to call a method or access a class member that does not exist.



The example below shows the method  *SayGoodbye*  being called through  *Class1* . As we can see  *Class1*  does not contain a definition for the method  *SayGoodbye* .

Errors displayed in this example:


```
error CS1061: Type `Class1' does not contain a definition for `SayGoodbye' and no extension method `SayGoodbye' of type `Class1' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)
```


**Resolution**



To fix the  *CS1061* error you will need to ensure that the method or class member does exist and is being accessed from the correct location.
