When Unity compiles your scripts, you will receive the following error.


```
CS8025: Parsing error

You may experience this error after you paste parts of exiting code into a script, or when you add a new function and the closing curly brace is missing.



**Resolution**



Ensure that the script is structured correctly like so:

Ensuring that the braces  **("{", "}")** encase the script within the functions and also the functions within the class.

Tip: When *debugging a script it is also useful to look at the lines that proceed the line that an error is displayed on as it can be caused by incomplete code.*
