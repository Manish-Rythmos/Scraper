**Symptoms**


- When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS1501: No overload for method `___' takes `___' arguments
```


**Cause**



The  *CS1501*  error is caused when a method is being invoked but is not being passed the correct number of arguments.



In this example we are trying to invoke a method that takes two arguments but we are not passing the method any arguments.

Here is how the error appears in this example:


```
error CS1501: No overload for method `DestroyAnEnemy' takes `0' arguments
```


**Resolution**



The error  *CS1501*  is resolved by ensuring that the correct number of arguments are being passed into the method being invoked.
