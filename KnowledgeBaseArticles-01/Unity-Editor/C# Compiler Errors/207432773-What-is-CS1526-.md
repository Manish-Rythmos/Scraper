**Symptoms**



When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS1526: A new expression requires () or [] after type
```


**Cause**



The CS1526 error is displayed when the new operator is not specified correctly.



In the example below we have declared an array, but have missed out the squared brackets.

**Resolution**



To resolve the CS1526 error you will need to add the correct parentheses to the declaration, squared brackets for an array and round brackets when creating a new object as show below.
