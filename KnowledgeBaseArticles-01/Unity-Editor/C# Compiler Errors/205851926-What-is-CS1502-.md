**Symptoms**


- You are calling a method in your script and you receive the following error:


```
error CS1502: The best overloaded method match for `______________' has some invalid arguments.
```


**Cause**



This error occurs when the argument types being passed to a method do not match the parameter types of that method. If the called method is overloaded, then none of the overloaded versions has a signature that matches the argument types being passed.
