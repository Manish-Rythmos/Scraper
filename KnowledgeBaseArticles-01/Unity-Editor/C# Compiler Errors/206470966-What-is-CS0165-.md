**Symptoms**



When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:


```
error CS0165: Use of unassigned local variable `___'
```


**Cause**



The  *CS0165* error is caused when a variable created within a method is not assigned with a value using the `new` keyword.

Here is how the error appears in this example:


```
error CS0165: Use of unassigned local variable `tempList'
```


**Resolution**



The error  *CS0165* is resolved by assigning the local variable with a new instance of it's type or as a reference to a variable of the same type.
