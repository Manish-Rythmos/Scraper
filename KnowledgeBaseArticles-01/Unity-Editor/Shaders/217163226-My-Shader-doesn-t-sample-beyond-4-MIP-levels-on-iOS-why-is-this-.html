        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am finding that my MIP maps seem to be missing when I sample them in Metal or GLES on an Apple iOS device.&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The issue you&apos;re finding is as designed. On iOS, GLES gets clamped (GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL=3), which prevents looking past the fourth MIP level in compressed Textures. This is due to the minimum MIP size being limited to 16 pixels by the driver. This doesn&apos;t occur on Metal, but has been capped by Unity to make functionality consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To get round this, you can switch to a non-PVRTC form of compression ( <strong>Compressed</strong>  and  <strong>Crunched</strong>  both use PVRTC).</p>

<p>This isn&apos;t the case if you use 16-bit or 24-bit (true color) for your Texture compression. This is will come with a larger memory footprint, but will behave as you expect.</p>
