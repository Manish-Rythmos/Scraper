[{"title":"My Shader doesn't sample beyond 4 MIP levels on iOS - why is this?","authorName":"Peter Nicholson.","createdDate":"2016-11-25T15:29:31Z","updatedDate":"2017-01-24T09:47:19Z","labels":["Shaders","iOS","cubemap","mip"],"sections":[{"title":"Symptoms","content":["\n<li>I am finding that my MIP maps seem to be missing when I sample them in Metal or GLES on an Apple iOS device.&#xA0;</li>\n"]},{"title":"Cause","content":["The issue you&apos;re finding is as designed. On iOS, GLES gets clamped (GL_TEXTURE_MAX_LEVEL=3), which prevents looking past the fourth MIP level in compressed Textures. This is due to the minimum MIP size being limited to 16 pixels by the driver. This doesn&apos;t occur on Metal, but has been capped by Unity to make functionality consistent."]},{"title":"Resolution","content":["To get round this, you can switch to a non-PVRTC form of compression (<strong>Compressed</strong> and <strong>Crunched</strong> both use PVRTC).","<img src=\"/hc/en-us/article_attachments/211106023/Screen_Shot_2016-11-25_at_15.18.42.png\" alt=\"\">","This isn&apos;t the case if you use 16-bit or 24-bit (true color) for your Texture compression. This is will come with a larger memory footprint, but will behave as you expect."]},{"title":"More Information","content":["For more information, consult the following documentation:","\n<li><a href=\"http://http.developer.nvidia.com/Cg/texCUBElod.html\">CG Shader texCUBElod reference</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporterOverride.html\">Texture importer override documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html%20\">Texture importer documentation</a></li>\n","<span>Save</span>"]}]}]
