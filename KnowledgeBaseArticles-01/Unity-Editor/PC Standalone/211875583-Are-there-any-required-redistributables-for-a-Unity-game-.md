**Symptoms**


- I would like to know if Unity games require additional redistributables (for example Visual Studio Runtime, DirectX, or .NET)?



**Cause**



Sometimes PC games require additional files to be included with the installation. When shipping with Steam there is a list of redistributables it can automatically install for a game.



**Resolution**



If you use DirectX, it makes sense to let Steam install it, but you do not need the Visual Studio redistributables, or the .NET runtime.
