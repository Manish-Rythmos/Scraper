The best advice would be to make sure to render everything you need in the same frame. To clarify, you should not render some textures in one frame and use them in another frame. Specifically from the Image Effects package, the &quot;motion blur&quot; effect uses a render texture from the previous frame.<br><br>If you are not rendering textures in one frame and using them in another, it is difficult to say whether SLI will be faster. SLI is transparent to the programmer and nothing has to be done explicitly from the code for it to be used, which is a problem because there is little control over how it works. In the worst case scenario, you will not get a performance boost.","&#xA0;"]},{"title":"More Information","content":["<a href=\"http://developer.amd.com/media/gpu_assets/Programming_for_CrossFire.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://developer.amd.com/media/gpu_assets/Programming_for_CrossFire.pdf</a><br><a href=\"http://developer.download.nvidia.com/whitepapers/2011/SLI_Best_Practices_2011_Feb.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">http://developer.download.nvidia.com/whitepapers/2011/SLI_Best_Practices_2011_Feb.pdf</a>","<a href=\"http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/298732/does-unity-support-crossfire-or-sli.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/298732/does-unity-support-crossfire-or-sli.html</a>","&#xA0;"]}]}]
