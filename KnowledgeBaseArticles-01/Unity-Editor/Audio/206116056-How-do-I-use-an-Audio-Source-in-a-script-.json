The Audio Source is a controller for starting and stopping playback of that clip, and modifying other audio properties. Audio Sources need to be attached as a component to a GameObject. GameObjects do not do anything on their own. You need to add the Audio Source as a component to a GameObject to make this object become an Audio feature.</span>","<span>To create a new Audio Source:</span>","\n<li><span>Import your audio files into your Unity Project.
