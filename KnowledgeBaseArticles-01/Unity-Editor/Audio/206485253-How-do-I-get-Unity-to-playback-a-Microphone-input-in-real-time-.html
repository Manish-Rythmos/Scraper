        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to develop an application with my Microphone device</li>
<li>I cannot get real time audio playback from my Microphone input without latency occurring</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You are unable to play back audio from a Microphone source in real time. You may be experiencing one of the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>During playback you can hear an inaudible chopped noise</li>
<li>The audio recorded continues to play in an infinite feedback loop</li>
<li>The audio heard during playback has a fair amount of latency and does not sound immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To ensure your Microphone audio plays back in real time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, you will need to set the microphone as an  <strong>AudioClip</strong>  and attach this  <strong>AudioClip</strong>  onto an  <strong>Audio Source</strong> . You will need to set the audio to loop by checking the loop tick box in your  <strong>Audio Source</strong>  component in the Inspector. You will then be able to use the spectrum data off the  <strong>Audio Source</strong> , rather than the  <strong>Audio Listener.</strong> </li>
<li>Secondly, you will need to attach a script to the  <strong>Audio Source</strong>  which tells Unity that the Microphone device to start recording an  <strong>AudioClip</strong> . For this you will need to call  <strong>Microphone.Start(); </strong> </li>
</ol>
<p>To control latency you will also need to call  <em><strong>Microphone.GetPosition();</strong> </em>  and choose your desired latency sample rate. If you want no latency you can set this to  <strong><em>&#x201C;0&#x201D;</em> </strong>  samples before the audio starts to play. See the below script to see how this script is executed.</p>

<p>Please note that&#xA0;you need to add the permissions to the app (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Web Player), to use the microphone. The permissions are added if you have a reference to  <strong>UnityEngine.Microphone</strong>  in your script.</p>
<p>However, on Android specifically this feature is not strictly required as it breaks compatibility with Android TV.</p>
