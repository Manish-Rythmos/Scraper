You will need to set the audio to loop by checking the loop tick box in your </span><strong>Audio Source</strong><span> component in the Inspector. You will then be able to use the spectrum data off the </span><strong>Audio Source</strong><span>, rather than the </span><strong>Audio Listener.</strong></li>\n<li><span>Secondly, you will need to attach a script to the </span><strong>Audio Source</strong><span> which tells Unity that the Microphone device to start recording an </span><strong>AudioClip</strong><span>. For this you will need to call </span><strong>Microphone.Start(); </strong></li>\n","<span>To control latency you will also need to call </span><em><strong>Microphone.GetPosition();</strong></em><span> and choose your desired latency sample rate. If you want no latency you can set this to </span><strong><em>&#x201C;0&#x201D;</em></strong><span> samples before the audio starts to play. See the below script to see how this script is executed.</span>","<img src=\"/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201975443/4.png\" alt=\"\">","Please note that&#xA0;you need to add the permissions to the app (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Web Player), to use the microphone. The permissions are added if you have a reference to <strong>UnityEngine.Microphone</strong> in your script.","However, on Android specifically this feature is not strictly required as it breaks compatibility with Android TV."]},{"title":"More Information","content":["<span>For scripting reference to calling </span><strong>Microphone.Start();</strong> <span>then see this document </span><a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Microphone.Start.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>here</span></a>","<span>For scripting reference to calling </span><strong>Microphone.GetPosition();</strong> <span>then see this document </span><a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Microphone.GetPosition.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span>here</span></a>","&#xA0;"]}]}]
