        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I use Camera.main many times in scripts and I want to optimize my game performance.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Camera.main takes more time to execute than you might expect. If you use it many times per game loop, you will be wasting time unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Below you can see the cost reported by the profiler&#xA0;Camer.main (Camer.get_main() in the profiler) when being called 100000 times in this extreme example.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You should store a reference to each of your Cameras once in the lifetime of that Camera, and then use that stored reference in the rest of the code. For example:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>// Initialization code for scene</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Camera mainCamera = Camera.main;</strong> </p>
<p><strong>// Game code, executed once per frame or more</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Vector3 pos = mainCamera.transform.position;</strong> </p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Below is the same test as above but using the Camera MainCamera = Camera.main reference instead of calling Camer.main. You can see the time spent in Update() is considerably lower.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>Camera.main returns the first Camera in the scene tagged &quot;MainCamera&quot;, so it may be slower if you have additional Cameras that are tagged differently. Even for a single Camera, the tag checking means it will always be slower than a direct reference.</p>
