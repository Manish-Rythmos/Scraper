**Symptoms**


- How do I switch to a PS4/ PSVita or other Sony platform?
- I want to deploy to a Playstation platform, how can I do this?



**Cause**



If you attempt to build to a Sony platform, you will be faced with the following (or a similar) message if you are not using a Playstation license:



â€œYour license does not cover PS4 publishing"



**Resolution**



To start working on PS4 or other Sony platform, you will need to be a registered Sony developer in order to use the Playstation license. To acquire the license you should contact your representative at Sony. They will be able to provide you with a license for you to use and work on your project/game for your choice of Sony hardware.



To register as a Sony Developer, please go to the following [link](http://www.scedev.net/).
