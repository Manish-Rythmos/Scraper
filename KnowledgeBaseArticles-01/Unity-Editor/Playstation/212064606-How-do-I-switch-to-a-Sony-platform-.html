<li>How do I switch to a PS4/ PSVita or other Sony platform?</li>
<li>I want to deploy to a Playstation platform, how can I do this?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If you attempt to build to a Sony platform, you will be faced with the following (or a similar) message if you are not using a Playstation license:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Your license does not cover PS4 publishing&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To start working on PS4 or other Sony platform, you will need to be a registered Sony developer in order to use the Playstation license. To acquire the license you should contact your representative at Sony. They will be able to provide you with a license for you to use and work on your project/game for your choice of Sony hardware. </p>
