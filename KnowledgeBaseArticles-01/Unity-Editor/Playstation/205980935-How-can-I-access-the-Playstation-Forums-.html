        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have received my Unity Playstation license from Sony</li>
<li>I would like to gain access to the Playstation developer forums</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Forums are a useful tool for interacting with other developers and solving common problems, not to mention networking. We do not however have a PS developer area within our Unity Forums in the way that we do for XBox developers.<br></p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity does not have a dedicated Playstation area in our forums. We advise all our PS developers to talk to their Sony representatives about gaining access to this <a href="http://scedev.net/" target="_blank">forum</a>.<br></p>
