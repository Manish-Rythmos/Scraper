**Symptoms**


- There is a loss of information when trying to merge scenes and prefabs into a version control system.
- I receive a notification that there is a merge conflict.



**Cause**



This can occur if you are working in a project with several people and two or more persons are modifying the same scene/prefab.



**Resolution**



In Unity 5, a smart merge tool was added called YAML merge tool.  Please review the [documentation](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html) for information and guidance.
