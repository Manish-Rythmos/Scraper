        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to remove the &apos;Made with Unity&apos; Splash Screen from my build</li>
<li>I am unable to remove the Unity Splash Screen from my project</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The &apos;Made with Unity&apos; Splash Screen plays while your&#xA0;game is loading. You may want to&#xA0;insert a custom splash screen, or remove the splash entirely.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><em><strong>Personal Edition Users:</strong> </em> </p>
<p>Personal Edition (free) users are unable to remove the Unity Splash Screen from projects.</p>
<p><em><strong>Plus and Pro Users:</strong> </em> </p>
<p>If you have a Unity Plus or Pro license, you can remove the Unity Splash Screen through this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your project in Unity and Click &apos;Edit&apos;</li>
<li>Click &apos;Project Settings&apos; and then &apos;Player&apos; in the menu that appears next.</li>
<li>In the Inspector tab, you will see a new section called &apos;Splash Image&apos;</li>
</ol>

<p class="wysiwyg-indent3">4. Click on the box next to &apos;Show Unity Splash Screen&apos; to remove the Unity Splash Screen.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are building to Android, you must have a splash screen for your build, whether the Unity Splash Screen, or a personal one, or both. Without a splash image, the Android build will not work.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>We are working on a new, customisable Splash Screen, which will available soon. For more information, please see this <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/07/22/in-development-unity-splash-screen-tools/" target="_blank">Blog post</a>.</p>
