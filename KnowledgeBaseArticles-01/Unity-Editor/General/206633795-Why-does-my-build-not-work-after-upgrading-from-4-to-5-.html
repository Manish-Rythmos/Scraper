        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I upgraded from Unity 4 to Unity 5</li>
<li>I can no longer build my game to iOS/Android platforms</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You have created a project&#xA0;using Unity 4 and build this scene for iOS/Android&#xA0;successfully in the UI system.</p>
<p>You have then upgraded to Unity 5 and when you load your project, you are not able to&#xA0;build to iOS/Android as&#xA0;the UI system is not working anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The UI system in Unity 4&#xA0;and 5 are slightly different. If you created a game in Unity 4, you can create a duplicate of the project for Unity 5.</p>
<p>If you were previously using assets from the Asset Store in your Unity 4 project&#xA0;you will need to&#xA0;completely remove these from the duplicate project and download the newest versions of each asset and re-import them into your Unity 5 project.</p>
