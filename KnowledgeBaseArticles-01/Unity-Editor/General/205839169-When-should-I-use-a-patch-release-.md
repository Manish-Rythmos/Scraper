**Symptoms**


- I have been notified that there is a new patch release of Unity
- I would like some advice as to when to update



**Cause**



If you are near the end of your game development, you may want to know if you need to use the most recent patch release.



If you are part of a company or institution with many licenses/activations, it may be time consuming to update, so you need to know whether or not to go ahead.



**Resolution**



Each patch release is a full release of the Editor with all runtimes and contains a number of bug fixes.



If you are not affected by the bugs fixed in a patch release, you do not need to use a patch release.



It is recommended that the patch releases are only used for projects which are critically affected by a bug and need the patch to make progress.



**More Information**



You can find out more information about the specific bugs fixed in each patch release by looking at the Unity QA patch releases archive [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases)
