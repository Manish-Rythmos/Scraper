        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have been notified that there is a new patch release of Unity</li>
<li>I would like some advice as to when to update</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If you are near the end of your game development, you may want to know if you need to use the most recent patch release.</p>
<p>If you are part of a company or institution with many licenses/activations, it may be time consuming to update, so you need to know whether or not to go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Each patch release is a full release of the Editor with all runtimes and contains a number of bug fixes.</p>
<p>If you are not affected by the bugs fixed in a patch release, you do not need to use a patch release.&#xA0;</p>
<p>It is recommended&#xA0;that the patch releases are only used for projects which are&#xA0;critically affected by a bug and need the patch to make progress.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>You can find out more information about the specific bugs fixed in each patch release by looking at the Unity QA patch releases archive&#xA0;<a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases" target="_blank">here</a></p>
