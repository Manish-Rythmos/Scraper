        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to be alerted via email&#xA0;whenever a new Patch is released.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may wish to know the minute a new Patch is released if it contains a bug fix which is helpful to your project.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to be notified about a new Patch Release:</p>
<p>To see the latest Patch Releases you can either go directly to the QA Patch archive <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Or, you can subscribe to this <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-patch-releases.246198/" target="_blank">thread.</a></p>
<p>If you want to be notified of new Patch Releases, you can click on the&#xA0; <strong>Watch Thread</strong> &#xA0;command, which can be found just above the first post on the page. This lets you tell the Forum system to send you an email whenever a new post is made to the thread.</p>
<p><strong><em>Please note,&#xA0;you will&#xA0;have to specify if you want to be notified by email; the default setting is to notify you through only your forum profile/control panel.</em> </strong> </p>
