        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have a Unity Pro license, but I cannot find the Flash build option</li>
<li>I had a Flash add-on license attached to my Unity Pro 4 license, but when I upgraded to Unity 5, I cannot deploy to Flash any more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unity supported Flash in 4.x and earlier, but this is no longer the case with Unity 5.x</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity stopped supporting Flash in April 2013. It is not available to use in Unity 5.&#xA0;</p>
<p>If you already have a Pro license for Unity 4.x or below, which includes the Flash add-on, you will be able to create and build projects to Flash within those versions of Unity.</p>
