        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>There is a loss of information when trying to merge scenes and prefabs into a&#xA0;version control system.</li>
<li>I receive a notification that there is a merge conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This can occur if you are working in a project with several people and two or more persons are modifying the same scene/prefab.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>In Unity 5, a&#xA0;smart merge tool was added called YAML merge tool.&#xA0; Please review the <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SmartMerge.html" target="_blank">documentation</a> for information and guidance.</p>
