**Symptoms**


- I have a Unity Pro license, but I cannot find the Flash build option
- I had a Flash add-on license attached to my Unity Pro 4 license, but when I upgraded to Unity 5, I cannot deploy to Flash any more



**Cause**



Unity supported Flash in 4.x and earlier, but this is no longer the case with Unity 5.x



**Resolution**



Unity stopped supporting Flash in April 2013. It is not available to use in Unity 5.



If you already have a Pro license for Unity 4.x or below, which includes the Flash add-on, you will be able to create and build projects to Flash within those versions of Unity.
