**Symptoms**


- I have found a bug within my project
- I am experiencing a bug in the UI system
- I am experiencing trouble with a game on Facebook



**Cause**



If Unity is not working like you expect it to this may be due to a technical problem. You may have experienced an issue similar to the following:


- You have experienced a crash which has closed Unity and is preventing you from re-opening the editor
- You are receiving an error in your Console.
- You are experiencing trouble with a published game. This can be caused by a bug in the Unity Web Player



**Resolution**



The first port of call is to check our [Forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/) and [Answers](http://answers.unity3d.com/) pages. It may be that our Community of users have resolved the issue and posted publicly there.



If you cannot find a workaround, you will need to submit a bug. To submit a bug report, first go into the editor.



1. Click on  **Help**  and select  **Report a bug**  from the drop down menu.



2. Specify from the drop down menus what the problem is related to and how often this happens.



3. Enter a valid email address and complete the title and description fields.



4. Finally, click  **Send**  to submit your bug report.

*Please note, if you cannot get into the Editor, email your issue to [bugs@unity3d.com](mailto:bugs@unity3d.com).*



When your bug is submitted, you will receive an automatic confirmation email containing your bug number. The QA Team will then assign it to the correct Team to work on a fix.



If your bug does not get a response within 2 weeks, it may be that your specific bug is fixed in a later release, or has available workarounds. You can contact support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new) to check this.
