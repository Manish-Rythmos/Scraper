 <strong>Symptoms</strong> 

<ul>
<li>I do not understand how the Anisotropic Textures field in Quality Settings affects the Aniso Level for each of my textures.</li>
<li>The anisotropic filtering&#xA0;for my textures is not what I expected.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-QualitySettings.html" target="_blank">Anisotropic Textures</a> field in Quality Settings has the options Disabled, Per Texture and Forced On. It can be confusing how this relates to the Aniso Level exposed in the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-TextureImporter.html" target="_blank">Texture Importer</a> for each texture. </p>

 <strong>Resolution</strong> 
&#xA0;
In the Texture Importer, an Aniso Level of either&#xA0;0 or&#xA0;1 means disabled; higher values represent different levels of Anisotropic filtering.
The setting in Quality Settings (Anisotropic Textures) can be Disabled, Per Texture or Forced On. This is where Aniso Level 0 and 1 differ; 0 means always disabled and 1 (and higher values) can be overridden by the setting in Quality Settings. Forced On clamps the Aniso Level&#xA0;between 9 and 16 (unless a texture has Aniso Level set to 0, in which case it stays disabled for that texture).
