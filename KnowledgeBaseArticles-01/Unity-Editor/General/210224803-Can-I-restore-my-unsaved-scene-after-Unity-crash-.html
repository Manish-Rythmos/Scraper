         <strong>Symptoms</strong> 

<ul>
<li>Unity Editor crashed after pressing the Play button and all my changes are unsaved.</li>
</ul>

 <strong>Cause</strong> 
Unity saves your scene each time when you hit the Play button.&#xA0;It is not saved over the original scene file, instead it is&#xA0;saved in the project&#x2019;s&#xA0;Temp&#xA0;directory.
&#xA0;
 <strong>Resolution</strong> 
&#xA0;
If you want to restore your scene file, you cannot re-launch Unity Editor after the crash. If you do, you will lose the scene file and all your progress with it!
&#xA0;
If you want to restore your crashed scene, you have to go to your project&#x2019;s&#xA0;directory&#xA0;(this is the folder&#xA0;that also contains the Assets directory) then enter the&#xA0;Temp/__Backupscenes directory. You will find the 0.backup file within. This is your saved scene file.&#xA0;
&#xA0;
Now all you have to do is to copy this file and replace your previous scene file with the copy. You will need to set the file extension to&#xA0; <em>unity</em>  in order to make this&#xA0;file recognizable as Unity scene file.
&#xA0;
Please remember to backup your project folder before making this kind of changes. If you make any mistake, you can easily go back and try again.
