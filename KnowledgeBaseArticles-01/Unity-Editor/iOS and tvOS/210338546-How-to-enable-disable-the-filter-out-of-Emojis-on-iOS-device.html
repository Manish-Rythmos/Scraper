        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> &#xA0;</p>
<ul>
<li>We had implemented support for Emoji characters (from the standard Unity keyboard) and now, using Unity 5.3+, they seem to be stripped out of the string that is exposed for use in Unity.</li>
<li>We would like to enable the filter out of Emoji characters for our iOS app.</li>
<li>We would like to disable the filter out of Emoji characters for our iOS app.</li>
<li>Emoji characters are not supported by Unity, but we have our custom solution using a plug-in. &#xA0;Now our solution is failing because Unity is filtering out the emoji characters. &#xA0;We want to remove the filtering.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unity currently supports code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000 - U+FFFF), but cannot handle code points in any of the Supplemental Planes (U+10000 - U+10FFFF). So, Emoji is not supported in Unity at the moment. Support for Emoji is in the Unity roadmap, but we do not yet have an estimated release date yet.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To enable/disable filter&#xA0;out of Emojis, please go to the trampoline code, file  <strong>Keyboard.mm</strong>  and change the value for the macro  <strong>FILTER_EMOJIS_IOS_KEYBOARD</strong>  to 0 for enabling, 1 for disabling.</p>
