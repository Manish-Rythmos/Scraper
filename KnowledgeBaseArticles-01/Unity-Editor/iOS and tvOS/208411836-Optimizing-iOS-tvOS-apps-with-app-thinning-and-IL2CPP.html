        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>App size is bigger&#xA0;than the over-the-air download limit and&#xA0;forces iOS users to download the app via WiFi.</li>
<li>I want to use resource slicing and bitcode on iOS and tvOS.</li>
<li>I use AssetBundles, but I would like to support&#xA0;on-demand resources on iOS and tvOS.</li>
<li>The universal binary of the app or single slices are bigger than allowed from the Apple submission guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>My app is bigger than the over-the-air download limit on iOS and bigger than the main application bundle size on tvOS.&#xA0;</p>
<p>I want to get the best download size, storage utilisation and runtime performance for my iOS and tvOS app.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.unix.com/man-page/osx/1/otool/">otool</a> report shows that single binary slices (32bit, 64bit) or the universal binary are bigger than the allowed limits from the Apple submission guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH35-SW1">App slicing</a> is very useful on iOS and tvOS platforms, as&#xA0;it helps the developers to pack more assets into the initial app bundle and still stay within the over-the-air download limit on iOS and main application bundle size on tvOS. There are two flavors of app slicing: app executable slicing and app resource slicing.</p>

<li>Read more about resource slicing in <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/208412046">Optimizing iOS &amp; tvOS app size with resource slicing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/On_Demand_Resources_Guide/" target="_blank">on-demand resources</a> to both reduce initial application download sizes and reduce the device storage usage by removing no longer needed assets.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/05/06/an-introduction-to-ilcpp-internals/">IL2CPP</a> converts ahead-of-time (AOT) C# code into C++ code which will be compiled into the final binary of your app using&#xA0;XCode and LLVM. This can lead to bigger universal binaries or app slices (32bit,64bit). You code can be optimised.</p>
