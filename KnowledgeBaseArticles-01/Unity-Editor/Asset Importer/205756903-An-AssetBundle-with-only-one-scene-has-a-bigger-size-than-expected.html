        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>An AssetBundle with only one scene has a bigger size than expected, but all the GameObjects in the scene are in other AssetBundles.&#xA0;</li>
<li>If I edit the manifest file, it looks fine.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> <br>The AssetBundle which includes only the scene also includes the default shaders. It is showed on the Editor.log as&#xA0;unity_builtin_extra.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a new Standard Surface Shader, add to another AssetBundle and rebuild the AssetBundles.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Download the built-in shaders from <a href="http://unity3d.com/get-unity">http://unity3d.com/get-unity</a> and include those shaders in your project. Change the first line of the built-in&#xA0;shaders from  <em>Shader &quot;Skybox/Cubemap&#x201D;</em>  to  <em>Shader &#x201C;AssetBundles/Skybox/Cubemap</em> &#x201D;. Add them all to an AssetBundle and assign to your objects.</li>
</ul>
