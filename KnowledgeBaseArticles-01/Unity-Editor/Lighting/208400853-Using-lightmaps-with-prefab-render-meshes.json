By default, the drop down is set to <strong>Automatic</strong>. This will strip the lightmap variants of the shader if none in the scenes are found. You can set these to be overridden&#xA0;by setting the drop down to <strong>Manual</strong>. This will give you the options seen in the screen capture below. You can leave them all ticketed if you are unsure which lighting type you will be using. Specifying the lightmap types will help optimise the shader variants however.","<img src=\"/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203250323/Screen_Shot_2016-03-11_at_12.00.23.png\" alt=\"\">&#xA0;"]},{"title":"More Information","content":["<a href=\"http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/problems-with-instantiating-baked-prefabs.324514/\">http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/problems-with-instantiating-baked-prefabs.324514/</a>","<a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OptimizingShaderLoadTime.html\">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OptimizingShaderLoadTime.html</a>","<a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GraphicsSettings.html\">http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GraphicsSettings.html</a>","This article applies to Unity version 5.3","&#xA0;"]}]}]
