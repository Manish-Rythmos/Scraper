        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have received my Unity Xbox license from Microsoft</li>
<li>I would like to gain access to the Unity Xbox developer forums</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Forums are a useful tool for interacting with other developers and solving common problems, not to mention networking. The Xbox forums are a dedicated area of our Unity forums and are not accessable automatically.<br></p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity has a dedicated forum area for our Xbox developers, which can be found <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/forums/xbox-one-development.62/" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>To gain access, please follow this process: </p>

<li>Your existing Unity Account user name(s). &#xA0;They must be accounts that have logged into the Unity forums at least once.</li>
</ul>
<p>The email addresses that you include in the process above are then registered with ID@Xbox. &#xA0;These email addresses will be given access to the Google Group page to access download links, as well as the dedicated forum area.</p>
