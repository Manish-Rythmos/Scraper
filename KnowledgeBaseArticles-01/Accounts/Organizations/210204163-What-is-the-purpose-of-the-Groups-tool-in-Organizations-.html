<li>What is the Groups tool option in Organizations used for?</li>
<li>I would like to know how to manage users in my Organization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>As an Owner or Manager within an Organization, you may want to move members within the Organization to work in different Projects or teams. The Groups tool makes it simple to manage this.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>Groups is a tool to help larger Organizations share Unity projects among sets of people. An Owner or Manager of an Organization can take members of his/her Organization, assign them to a Group and add that Group to a Unity project, thereby giving members in that Group access to work on the Project.</p>
