**Symptoms**


- I have an Organization on my Unity account that I do not wish to use.
- There are a number of different Organizations on my Unity account. I wish to delete the duplicate Organizations.



**Cause**



You can see current Organizations in your [account](https://accounts.unity3d.com/organizations).

You can update the name of your Organization and invite new members to join by clicking on the  **Settings**  button. There is an button to add a  **New Organization** , but there is no button to delete the Organizations you have created.



**Resolution**



There is not an option to delete Organizations from your account at present. Unity is currently working on creating a feature to make this possible for the future.



You might not be able to delete the Organization, but a recommended workaround is to rename it and recycle it.



If the Organization does not belong to you, you can just leave the Organisation in the Organisation settings.
