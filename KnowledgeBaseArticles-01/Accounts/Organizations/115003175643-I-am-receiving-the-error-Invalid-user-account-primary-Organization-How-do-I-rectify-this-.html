<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I see an &apos;&apos;Invalid user account primary Organization&apos;&apos; error when trying to activate Unity on a new computer.</li>
<li>I am attempting to activate Unity and have received an error.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Causes</strong> </span></p>
<p>The Unity Editor cannot see your license servers due to something in your set up blocking this. </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>The error &apos;&apos;invalid user account primary Organization&apos;&apos; is usually related to your proxy settings. Therefore, make sure that proxies, firewalls, and internet security systems are not blocking Unity.</p>
<p>If you are having issues with proxies and firewalls in place, you can try allowing ports 443 and 80. You can also disable any anti-virus software you have running temporarily. If this does not help, you may want to try manually activating your license, following guidance <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The above link provides instructions on how to activate your license offline, once you have downloaded Unity from <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive">https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive</a>. You will need to disconnect from the Internet to perform manual activation! </p>
