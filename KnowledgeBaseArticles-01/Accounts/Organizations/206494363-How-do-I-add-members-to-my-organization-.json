This will send an email to the specified email address&#xA0;requesting that they create a new Unity ID Account. Once this has been completed, their account will automatically be added to your Organization members.","If you have any question about the Organizations in Unity Services please let us know in any of our Services <a href=\"http://forum.unity3d.com/\">forums</a>. &#xA0;","For more information about how to give access to other users with Unity Collaborate, see this <a href=\"https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/208804626\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>.","&#xA0;"]}]}]
