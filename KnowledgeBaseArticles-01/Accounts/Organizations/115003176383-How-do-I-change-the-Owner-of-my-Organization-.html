        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I wish to leave one of the Organizations I am in and want to give ownership to another user</li>
<li>I wish to become the Organization owner&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Owners within an Organization receive invoices and have more management rights than other roles. <br></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>There are two ways you can do this:</p>
<p><em><strong>If the current Owner still has access to the account</strong> </em> </p>
<ol>
<li>Sign into your account.&#xA0;</li>
<li>Click &quot;Organizations&quot;&#xA0;</li>
<li>Select the Organization you would like to make the change to.&#xA0;</li>
<li>Click &quot;Members &amp; Groups&quot;</li>
<li>Click &quot;See All&quot;</li>
<li>Look for the e-mail address belonging to the account you would like to make the owner and click the pencil icon next to the address to edit. </li>
<li>Select the drop down menu and choose &quot;Owner&quot; to give them all permissions.</li>
<li>The new Owner will have full access and be able to remove the previous Owner from the Organization, or set them to &apos;User&apos; if they want them to have access, but not as many management rights.</li>
</ol>
<p>If the person you desire to be the Owner is not in the Organization, please see this <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206494363-How-do-I-add-members-to-my-organization-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">article</a>.</p>
