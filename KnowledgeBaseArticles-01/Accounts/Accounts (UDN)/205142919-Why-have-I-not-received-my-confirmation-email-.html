<ul>
<li>I am trying to log into my Unity Account, but I see this message:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203304706/Screen_Shot_2016-03-30_at_14.39.51.png" alt="" width="505" height="347"></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>This is an issue&#xA0;that can sometimes occur due to one of these factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmation email has been sent to spam folder instead of your Inbox</li>
<li>You have signed up with a different email address</li>
<li>The email address was not spelled correctly</li>
<li>Confirmation email has not been sent immediately from our mailing server</li>
<li>System has not completed registration and the user will need to reattempt to sign up with the same email address</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>If you cannot see your confirmation email, first check your spam folder in case it has been sent there instead of your Inbox folder.</p>
<p>You can request your confirmation email is resent&#xA0;by clicking on the&#xA0; <strong>Can&apos;t find your confirmation email?</strong> &#xA0;button.</p>
<p>Enter the email address you created your Unity Account with and click the  <strong>Resend confirmation</strong> &#xA0;button.</p>
<p>Make sure you enter the email address correctly and your confirmation email should be resent to your inbox folder.</p>
<p><em>Please&#xA0;note,&#xA0;the system can get quite busy, so if you do not receive your confirmation email immediately you may need to wait a short time for it to be processed.</em> </p>
