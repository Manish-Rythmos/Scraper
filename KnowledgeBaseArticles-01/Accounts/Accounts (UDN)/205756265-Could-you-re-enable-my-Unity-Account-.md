**Cause**



Accounts can be disabled for many different reasons. Sometimes they are disabled by Moderators on the Asset store and Community pages. At other times, they are disabled due to the owners request.



The Finance team will suspend access to Unity Accounts if they have reason to suspect chargebacks, or other fraudulent behaviour on Subscription or Asset Store payments.



The Asset Store team also have the power to disable Unity Accounts on the grounds of Piracy and Copyright Infringement.



**Resolution**



If you want to re-enable an account then you can contact support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).



If the account can be re-enabled then it should not take long before the account is usable again.



If the account cannot be re-enabled, then the Support Team will notify you and also state the reasons why the account was disabled.
