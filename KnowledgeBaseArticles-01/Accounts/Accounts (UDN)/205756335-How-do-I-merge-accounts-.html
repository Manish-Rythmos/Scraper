<ul>
<li>I have created many different Unity accounts and wish to consolidate them into one.</li>
<li>An employee has left and I wish to merge their account with another.</li>
<li>A friend is giving me their account and I wish to merge it with my current Unity account.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not a way for us to merge accounts. We can only disable accounts.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>We cannot merge two accounts, or transfer asset purchases, however we can disable accounts if they are no longer in use.</p>
<p>To disable an account, please contact support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>, with your account email address and authorisation to disable the account.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>More Information</strong> </span></p>
<p>If you wish to merge accounts in order to save asset store purchases then there is an article on transferring assets between accounts <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205106909" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
