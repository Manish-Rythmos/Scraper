**Symptoms**


- I am trying to sign in [here](https://id.unity.com/account/edit).
- The Unity ID account pages will not load



**Cause**



In May 2016, we updated our systems to support tls1.2 only. This means that some Windows systems and browsers may no longer have access unless tls1.2 is enabled.



**Resolution**



If you come across this problem in your own system, please enable tls1.2.



Please see below for guidance:
