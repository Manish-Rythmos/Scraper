**Symptoms**


- I have misspelled my e-mail address.
- My old email address no longer exists.
- I wish to change my e-mail address.



**Cause**



Usually, you can change your email address from within the Accounts page of the Unity website, although with older accounts, this may not be the case.



**Resolution**



There are [2] different solutions, each dependent on your situation.



***I can still log into my account:***


1. Go [here](https://id.unity.com/account/edit).
2. Log in if you are not already logged in.
3. Enter a new e-mail address into the "E-mail" field by pressing the Pencil image to edit.



***I cannot log into my account any more:***



Please note: you do not need access to your e-mail address in order to log into your Unity account, as long as you know the password.



If you have lost access to the e-mail address and you have also forgotten the password then you can contact Support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).
