<ul>
<li>I have misspelled my e-mail address.</li>
<li>My old email address no longer exists.</li>
<li>I wish to change my&#xA0;e-mail address.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>Usually, you can change your email address from within the Accounts page of the Unity website, although with older accounts, this may not be the case.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>There are [2] different solutions, each dependent on your situation.</p>
<p><strong><em>I can still log into my account:</em> </strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>Go <a href="https://id.unity.com/account/edit" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Log in if you are not already logged in.</li>
<li>Enter a new e-mail address into the &quot;E-mail&quot; field by pressing the Pencil image to edit.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>I cannot log into my account any more:</em> </strong> </p>
<p>Please note: you do not need access to your e-mail address in order to log into your Unity account, as long as you know the password.</p>
<p>If you have lost access to the e-mail address and you have also forgotten the password then you&#xA0;can contact Support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
