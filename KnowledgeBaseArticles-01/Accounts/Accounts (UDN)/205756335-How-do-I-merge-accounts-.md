**Symptoms**


- I have created many different Unity accounts and wish to consolidate them into one.
- An employee has left and I wish to merge their account with another.
- A friend is giving me their account and I wish to merge it with my current Unity account.



**Cause**



Unfortunately, there is not a way for us to merge accounts. We can only disable accounts.



**Resolution**



We cannot merge two accounts, or transfer asset purchases, however we can disable accounts if they are no longer in use.



To disable an account, please contact support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new), with your account email address and authorisation to disable the account.



**More Information**



If you wish to merge accounts in order to save asset store purchases then there is an article on transferring assets between accounts [here](/hc/en-us/articles/205106909).
