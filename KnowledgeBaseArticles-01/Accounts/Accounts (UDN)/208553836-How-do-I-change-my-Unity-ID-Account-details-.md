**Symptoms**


- I would like to amend the name that is currently bound to my Unity account.
- I want to update my password.



**Cause**



You can edit your name (not username) and password from within the Accounts page on the Unity site.



Your Forum username matches your Unity username, so any amendments to your username can be done by following the guidelines in the 'How do I change my username' article found below in the 'More Information' section.



**Resolution**



You can change your name and password by going [here](https://accounts.unity3d.com/edit).
