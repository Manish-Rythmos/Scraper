**Symptoms**


- I am trying to reset my password and keep getting the error  *"Reset password token is invalid"*
- I am trying to change my password with the link but I get the error  *"Username is invalid"*
- I am trying to reset my password and keep getting the error  *"Invalid email"*



**Cause**



**If you receive the error  *"Reset password token is invalid":***



This is because you have not copied the URL link provided in the token reset email correctly into your browser or you are using a different email client.



**If you receive the error  *"Username is invalid":***



This is because our accounts server fails to recognize a username with uncommon characters such as "@!?.#()". In nearly all cases the user will need to change their Username to something valid so as not to confuse the system.



**If you have received the error  *"Email is invalid":***



This is because the email address is being entered incorrectly. You will need to make sure you are typing the email address all in lower case.



**Resolution**



To make sure your reset password token is valid, you will need to make sure you are copying the URL correctly and using the correct email client.
