Once the Account has been confirmed the process of account creation will be completed.



**More Information**



From 'My Account Settings' you can manage other parts of your account such as Subscriptions.



To Manage your subscription(s), please go to the following [link](https://id.unity.com/organizations).

If you use Google or Facebook to sign in to the Unity Editor or website, an account will be automatically created for you in our systems. If you later decide to create a Unity ID account with the same email, any purchases you made on your Facebook account will be tied to your new Unity ID account.
