<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You wish to allow students to join Unity Connect as a member of your Educational institution, and allow those posting jobs to recruit from your Schools page directly.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>There are two ways for users to create a Unity Connect Schools page!</p>
<p>1. Click the &apos; <em>Discover&apos;</em>  button on the site header, after which, you must click the &apos; <em>Schools&apos; </em> button. You will then see a large green button to the right hand side of the screen. This will state &apos; <em>Create a School&apos;, </em> and you can click on this!</p>

<p>Once you have clicked on the &apos; <em>Create a School</em> &apos; button, you will need to enter the specified details. These are the  <em>Schools Name</em> ,  <em>Location</em> , and  <em>Website</em> , as well as, a  <em>Description of the School</em> , an  <em>Identifying Photo</em>  and a  <em>Thumbnail Image</em> . When this is complete, you can then press the &apos; <em>Create</em> &apos; button.</p>
