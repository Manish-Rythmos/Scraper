        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am unable to apply for a job that is posted on Unity Connect.</li>
<li>Are there any restrictions in place for applying for jobs?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>There are a few restrictions in place that will not allow Talent on Unity Connect to apply for a job role.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Inability to apply for a job on Connect could be down to the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>The job you wish to apply for is now closed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You applied for this job before, and the Client did not accept, or rejected your proposal.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You already have a contract for this job. If the contract is ever completed or cancelled, you can apply for this job again.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You are the owner of the job post.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>If you are unable to apply for a role that is not caused by the points above, then please <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new%20" target="_blank">contact</a> Support.</p>
