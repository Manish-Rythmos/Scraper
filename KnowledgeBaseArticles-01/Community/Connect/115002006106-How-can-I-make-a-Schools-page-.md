**Symptoms**


- I would like to know how to create a Schools page for my Educational institution.



**Cause**



You wish to allow students to join Unity Connect as a member of your Educational institution, and allow those posting jobs to recruit from your Schools page directly.



**Resolution**



There are two ways for users to create a Unity Connect Schools page!



1. Click the ' *Discover'*  button on the site header, after which, you must click the ' *Schools'* button. You will then see a large green button to the right hand side of the screen. This will state ' *Create a School',* and you can click on this!

2. Hover your mouse over your initial on the top right corner of the site. Here, a drop down will appear, and the second option allows you to ' *Create a School'* .

Once you have clicked on the ' *Create a School* ' button, you will need to enter the specified details. These are the  *Schools Name* ,  *Location* , and  *Website* , as well as, a  *Description of the School* , an  *Identifying Photo*  and a  *Thumbnail Image* . When this is complete, you can then press the ' *Create* ' button.
