        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am an Employer looking for somewhere to post job adverts</li>
<li>I am a Contractor looking for work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>In the past, Unity ran a Commercial Forum for our Community to post job adverts and advertise their own skills. Unity Connect expands and develops on this idea.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><a href="https://connect.unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity Connect</a> is a free-to-use community tool for all users, of all experience levels, to connect with each other. This platform is designed for developers, artists, creators of digital media and others alike.<br></p>
<p>If you are looking for a job in the industry - this is where you start! By joining Unity Connect, job seekers will receive free portfolio tools and access to a huge network of peers, potential collaborators, and even employees.</p>
<p>As a  <strong>Unity Talent</strong>  member, you can create your profile, search, and apply for jobs that suit you.</p>
<p>As a  <strong>Unity Client</strong>  member, you can post jobs, search Talent, and invite Talent to jobs.</p>
<p>Our mission is to enable your success - Connecting you is everything.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>There is, and not ever be, a fee to apply for a job. In the near future, we will charge Clients for posting jobs, however charges will not be retroactively added to past job posts.</p>
