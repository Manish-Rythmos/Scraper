Depending on when you registered your original Account, we switched systems and if you did not log in during the migration period your accounts got a <em>_legacy tag</em>. All accounts with this <em>_legacy tag</em> were&#xA0;closed in the old system and the Usernames were added to a block list."]},{"title":"Resolution","content":["If your Username is not available then it may have been blocked for legacy reasons. If it is&#xA0;removed from the block list it will be unblocked and&#xA0;broken, so unfortunately this means we cannot retrieve the Username any more.","You have the option to adjust your Username&#xA0;with an accepted special character such as an underscore <strong><em>&quot;_&quot;</em></strong>, dash <strong><em>&quot;-&quot;</em></strong>, or add a number to make it unique. You can also choose to use a new Username entirely."]},{"title":"More Information","content":["For more information on changing your Username then see this article <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/205053589\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>","&#xA0;"]}]}]
