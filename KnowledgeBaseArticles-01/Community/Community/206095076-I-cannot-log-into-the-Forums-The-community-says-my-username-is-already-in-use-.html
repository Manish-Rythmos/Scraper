        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>When I log in to Unity Forums I am getting the following error:&#xA0; <em>&quot;Unity Community - Usernames&#xA0;must be unique. The specified Username&#xA0;is already in&#xA0;use.&quot;</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This could be due to one of two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your username&#xA0;includes&#xA0;uncommon characters such as &quot;@!?.#()&quot;.</li>
<li>Another user has already chosen that username.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You can change your username, or modify your current username to make it unique, by&#xA0;providing&#xA0;the Support Team&#xA0;with the following information:</p>
<p>E-mail address attached to the account.<br>New Username.<br>Alternate New Username.</p>
<p>In nearly all cases the user will need to get their Username changed to something valid (which does not include uncommon characters)&#xA0;in order to access the Forums.</p>
<p>You can contact Support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
