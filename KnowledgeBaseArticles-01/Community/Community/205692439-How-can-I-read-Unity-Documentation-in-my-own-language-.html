        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I do not have English as my first language</li>
<li>I would like to read the Documentation for Unity in my own language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We all know the perils of using translation software too much...</p>
<p>As such, we are working on making our content available in an increasingly broad range of languages. </p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Whilst this is still a work in progress, we have completed Documentation translations in these languages:</p>
<p><a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ru" target="_blank">Russian </a></p>
<p><a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/ja" target="_blank">Japanese </a></p>
<p><a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/es" target="_blank">Spanish </a></p>
<p>Watch this space for more translations soon...</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>We are currently working on Portuguese and Chinese translations, amongst others. </p>
<p>If you have another language that you would like to see our docs translated into, please submit your idea on our feedback page <a href="http://feedback.unity3d.com/%20">here</a>. The more users that vote for your idea, the more likely it will get done.</p>
<p>If you are a translator and are interested doing some work in a language not mentioned on this page, please get in touch with us <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p>
