It could be one of the following:","\n<li>Your question has already been answered in a different thread - please make sure to search for your question before posting, just in case another user has already posted about it</li>\n<li>Your post is not about Unity, or belongs in a different part of the Forum - the Forums are split into different areas, so be sure to post in the relevant one so that your question can be seen by the right users</li>\n<li>Your post does not have enough information - particularly with technical questions, you will be more likely to receive help if you are clear and specific about what the problem is. Including a section of your code can sometimes help as well.</li>\n<li>Your post contains many different, unrelated questions - this can be quite confusing for other users, so it&apos;s best to have different threads for different topics</li>\n<li>You post contains offensive material, or spam</li>\n"]},{"title":"Resolution","content":["We want our Community pages to be as straightforward and easy to navigate as possible.
