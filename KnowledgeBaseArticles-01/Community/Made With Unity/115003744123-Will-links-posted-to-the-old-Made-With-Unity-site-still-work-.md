**Symptoms**


- I have added links to my Made With Unity profile/ content on other sites
- Since MWU is migrating to Unity Connect, I am concerned these links will no longer direct properly



**Cause**



As of September 2017, Made With Unity will be part of the Unity Connect site and operating under a different URL.



**Resolution**



Links from [Made With Unity](http://madewith.unity.com/) automatically redirect to your new page on [Unity Connect](http://connect.unity.com)
