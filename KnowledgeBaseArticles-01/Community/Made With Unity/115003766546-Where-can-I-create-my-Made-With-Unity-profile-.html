        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I came to<a href="http://madewith.unity.com/"> madewith.unity.com</a> to create a new profile but noticed that you are migrating this functionality to Unity Connect.&#xA0;</li>
<li>I want to make a MWU profile, but I&apos;m not sure where to go.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Starting August 1 2017, madewith.unity.com is no longer approving new submissions as we prepare for story and profile migration to Unity Connect.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>New users can create a new account on Unity Connect as the new features will be available in early September. &#xA0;For the latest information on madewith.unity.com&#x2019;s move to Unity Connect, please read our <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/08/08/madewith-unity-com-profile-and-story-creation-is-moving-to-unity-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>.<br></p>
