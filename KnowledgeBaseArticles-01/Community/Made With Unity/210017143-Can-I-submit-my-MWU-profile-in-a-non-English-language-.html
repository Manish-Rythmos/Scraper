        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to submit my Made With Unity profile in a language other than English.</li>
<li>My first language is not English. I would prefer to submit my profile in my native language.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You are developer wanting to create a profile and story on our Made With Unity site. English is not your first language however, so you would like to submit your story in your native language.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, all MWU submissions must be made in English at this time.&#xA0;</p>
<p>We are aware that the Unity Community is expansive and diverse. It is made up of lots of nationalities that are non-English speaking countries. We will look to address this in future updates.</p>
