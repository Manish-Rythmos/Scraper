**Symptoms**


- I would like to submit my Made With Unity profile in a language other than English.
- My first language is not English. I would prefer to submit my profile in my native language.



**Cause**



You are developer wanting to create a profile and story on our Made With Unity site. English is not your first language however, so you would like to submit your story in your native language.



**Resolution**



Unfortunately, all MWU submissions must be made in English at this time.



We are aware that the Unity Community is expansive and diverse. It is made up of lots of nationalities that are non-English speaking countries. We will look to address this in future updates.
