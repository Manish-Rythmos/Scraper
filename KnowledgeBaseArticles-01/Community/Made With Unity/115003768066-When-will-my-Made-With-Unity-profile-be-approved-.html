        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I applied to Made With Unity some time ago </li>
<li>My MWU profile has not yet been approved</li>
</ul>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Made With Unity is in the process of migrating to the Unity Connect site, which means that new content is not currently being added to the site.<br></p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>As of August 1, 2017, profiles that are currently pending approval on Made with Unity will automatically be approved and created as part of the migration to Unity Connect in early September 2017. This is one of the most exciting benefits of the migration to Unity Connect: you will no longer be dependent on an approval process to publish and promote your work. If you have already been waiting a while, we apologize for the inconvenience and ask that you bear with us for just a bit longer.</strong> </p>
