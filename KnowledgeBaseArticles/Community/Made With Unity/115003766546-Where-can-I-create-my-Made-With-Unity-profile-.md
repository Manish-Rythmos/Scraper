*   I came to[ madewith.unity.com](http://madewith.unity.com/) to create a new profile but noticed that you are migrating this functionality to Unity Connect. 
*   I want to make a MWU profile, but I'm not sure where to go.

**Cause** 

Starting August 1 2017, madewith.unity.com is no longer approving new submissions as we prepare for story and profile migration to Unity Connect.

**Resolution** 

New users can create a new account on Unity Connect as the new features will be available in early September.  For the latest information on madewith.unity.com’s move to Unity Connect, please read our [blog post](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2017/08/08/madewith-unity-com-profile-and-story-creation-is-moving-to-unity-connect/).
