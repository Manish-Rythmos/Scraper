*   I am registered as a Unity Client member in Unity Connect
*   I wish to end a contract and would like to know the process

**Cause** 

You may want to terminate the contract for any number of reason. For example, the Contractor or Talent has completed the task, or they did not meet the time parameters for the job. Perhaps the person you employed finished the request,Â did an excellent job and you want to give them a good rating.

**Resolution** 

To end a contract, click Jobs > My Contracts.

Here you can manage your contracts and cancel them if you like.

**More Information** 

At the end of the contract, both parties will be able to rate each other on a 5 star system. Please keep in mind that these ratings affect someone's future connections.
