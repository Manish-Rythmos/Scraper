*   I am an Employer looking for somewhere to post job adverts
*   I am a Contractor looking for work

**Cause** 

In the past, Unity ran a Commercial Forum for our Community to post job adverts and advertise their own skills. Unity Connect expands and develops on this idea.

**Resolution** 

[Unity Connect](https://connect.unity.com/) is a free-to-use community tool for all users, of all experience levels, to connect with each other. This platform is designed for developers, artists, creators of digital media and others alike.  

If you are looking for a job in the industry - this is where you start! By joining Unity Connect, job seekers will receive free portfolio tools and access to a huge network of peers, potential collaborators, and even employees.

As a **Unity Talent** member, you can create your profile, search, and apply for jobs that suit you.

As a **Unity Client** member, you can post jobs, search Talent, and invite Talent to jobs.

Our mission is to enable your success - Connecting you is everything.

**More Information** 

There is, and not ever be, a fee to apply for a job. In the near future, we will charge Clients for posting jobs, however charges will not be retroactively added to past job posts.
