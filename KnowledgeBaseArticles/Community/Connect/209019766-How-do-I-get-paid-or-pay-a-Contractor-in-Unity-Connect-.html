        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a Client using Unity Connect and would like information on how to pay the Talent</li>
<li>I am Talent using Unity Connect to find work opportunities and wish to know more about how I will be paid</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>You are in a contract via Unity Connect and want to know how the payment system works between Client and Talent.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Payment for any work found or advertised on Unity Connect is managed solely between the Talent and Client.</p>
<p>Unity Connect does not manage payments and the responsibility to negotiate the sum and method of payment is to be decided between Talent and Client. Make sure you agree to the amount and honour the agreement.&#xA0;</p>
