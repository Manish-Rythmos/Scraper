        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to know how and where to find all current applicants to my job post(s).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You wish to see who has applied to your job or task post, and how to find this application.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>There are two ways to search for who has applied for your job post:</p>
<p>1. Click &apos; <em>Jobs&apos; </em> (on the page header), and then click the &apos; <em>Matches&apos; </em> tab to the left hand side of your page. This will then list your job applicants.</p>

<p>2. Alternatively, open your &apos; <em>Messages</em> &apos; in the top right corner of the site. This is represented by the chat icon. Your different job posts have different threads. These will correspond to all the matched applicants, and allow you to communicate with the applicants.</p>
