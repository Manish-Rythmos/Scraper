*   When I log in to Unity Forums I am getting the following error:  *"Unity Community - Usernames must be unique. The specified Username is already in use."* 

**Cause** 

This could be due to one of two reasons:

*   Your username includes uncommon characters such as "@!?.#()".
*   Another user has already chosen that username.

**Resolution** 

You can change your username, or modify your current username to make it unique, by providing the Support Team with the following information:

E-mail address attached to the account.  
New Username.  
Alternate New Username.

In nearly all cases the user will need to get their Username changed to something valid (which does not include uncommon characters) in order to access the Forums.

You can contact Support [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).

**More Information**
