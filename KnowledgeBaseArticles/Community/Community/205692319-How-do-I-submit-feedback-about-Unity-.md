*   I have some ideas for improvements that would help developers get a better workflow
*   I have some ideas to improve the Services integration  

**Cause** 

We have some pretty brilliant people here at Unity, but we cannot think of everything and are always willing to listen to suggestions.

**Resolution** 

Please check the [feedback](http://feedback.unity3d.com/) pages in case someone else has submitted the same idea already (As we say in the UK, ‘Great minds think alike!’).

If no one has submitted your idea as feedback, please feel free to create a new post. The more users vote for your idea, the more likely we are to look into implementing it.
