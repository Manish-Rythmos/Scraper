*   I have posted in the Unity Answers page
*   I can see a message on my post saying, "This post is currently awaiting moderation. If you believe this to be in error, contact a system administrator."

**Cause** 

New posts to our Answers page have to be moderated by our Community Team or Moderators. You can skip this step once you have obtained over 15 Karma points in the Unity Forums.

**Resolution** 

When you post in our Forums, you can accumulate Karma points by helping out other users and adding constructive replies to questions. Once you have 15 points, you can skip moderation on your own posts in Answers.

If you do not yet have 15 Karma points, your posts will still need to be manually checked by our Moderators for now. The Community Team work as quickly as possible to moderate the new posts.

**More Information** 

If your post has been rejected, please see the article [here](/hc/en-us/articles/206081526-Why-has-my-post-in-the-Forums-been-rejected-).
