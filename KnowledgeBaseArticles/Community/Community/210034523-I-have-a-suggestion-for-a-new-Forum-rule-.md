*   I have an idea for a new section on the Forums.
*   I believe a certain rule should be enforced on the Forums.

**Cause**

**Resolution** 

We welcome all Forum/rule suggestions to be posted in our [Feedback area](https://forum.unity3d.com/forums/forum-issues-feedback.111/). Please ensure that you have searched the Feedback pages to see if your suggestion has already been posted or not, as it may have already been discussed.
