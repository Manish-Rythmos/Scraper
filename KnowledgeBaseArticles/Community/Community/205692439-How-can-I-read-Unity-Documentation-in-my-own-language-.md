*   I do not have English as my first language
*   I would like to read the Documentation for Unity in my own language.

**Cause** 

We all know the perils of using translation software too much...

As such, we are working on making our content available in an increasingly broad range of languages. 

**Resolution** 

Whilst this is still a work in progress, we have completed Documentation translations in these languages:

[Russian ](http://docs.unity3d.com/ru)

[Japanese ](http://docs.unity3d.com/ja)

[Spanish ](http://docs.unity3d.com/es)

Watch this space for more translations soon...

**More Information** 

We are currently working on Portuguese and Chinese translations, amongst others. 

If you have another language that you would like to see our docs translated into, please submit your idea on our feedback page [here](http://feedback.unity3d.com/%20). The more users that vote for your idea, the more likely it will get done.

If you are a translator and are interested doing some work in a language not mentioned on this page, please get in touch with us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).
