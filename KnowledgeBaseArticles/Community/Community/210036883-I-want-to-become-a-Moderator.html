        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to apply to become a Forums Moderator for Unity&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We get many requests from users old and new at Unity wanting to become a Forum Moderator.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>We do not have a process in place in which Forum users can apply to become a moderator. Our Community Managers will approach those users who are exceedingly helpful and have a great online presence to become Moderators if positions are available.</p>
