*   I would like to know who are the current Administrators and Moderators of the Forum are.
*   How do I tell the Administrators and Moderators apart from the rest of the users on the Forum?

**Cause** The Forums have a team of Administrators and Moderators to ensure that all the content posted there by our users are within guidelines and help the flow of discussion by ensuring threads are in the designated sub-forums.

**Resolution** 

Administrators and Moderators of the Forum can be recognised by a blue badge under their avatar. Unity staff can also be recognised by a black banner under their avatar.
