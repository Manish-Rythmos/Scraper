*   I want to apply to become a Forums Moderator for UnityÂ 

**Cause** 

We get many requests from users old and new at Unity wanting to become a Forum Moderator.

**Resolution** 

We do not have a process in place in which Forum users can apply to become a moderator. Our Community Managers will approach those users who are exceedingly helpful and have a great online presence to become Moderators if positions are available.
