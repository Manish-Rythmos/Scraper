<ul>
<li>I have some ideas for improvements that would help developers get a better workflow</li>
<li>I have some ideas to improve the Services integration<br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We have some pretty brilliant people here at Unity, but we cannot think of everything and are always willing to listen to suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Please check the <a href="http://feedback.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">feedback</a> pages in case someone else has submitted the same idea already (As we say in the UK, &#x2018;Great minds think alike!&#x2019;).</p>
<p>If no one has submitted your idea as feedback, please feel free to create a new post. The more users vote for your idea, the more likely we are to look into implementing it.</p>
