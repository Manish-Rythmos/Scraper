        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have an Educational license<br></li>
<li>I have more than one machine that I need to activate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Often our Educational license holders need to activate on a full lab of machines at one time. Although this is not yet possible, we do now support batch file activation, which makes things a lot easier.<br></p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>It is not yet possible to activate more than one machine at a time. The quickest way to work through your lab is to activate silently by using this command line argument:<br><br>C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe&quot; -batchmode -username name@example.gov.uk -password XXXXXXXXXXXXX -serial&#xA0; E3-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX -quit<br></p>
<p>The email and password used will be the same as your Unity web account. If you are a Lecturer/ Teacher, please create an admin account to use for your manual activation. <br>Please see the attached document for more guidance and let us know if you have any further problems.</p>
<p>Also, please see the following tips which may help with activation too:</p>
<p>Please try allowing these ports: 80 and 443&#xA0;<br></p>
<p>You can also try whitelisting these URLs:<br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<a class="external-link" href="http://license.unity3d.com/" rel="nofollow">license.unity3d.com</a><br>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;<a class="external-link" href="http://activation.unity3d.com/" rel="nofollow">activation.unity3d.com</a><br></p>
