*   I have just installed Windows 10 on my computer.
*   I just updated my Operating System
*   On opening Unity, I receive an error and it will not activate.

**Cause** 

Unfortunately, sometimes our licenses are confused by a change in OS - essentially, it tricks the license file into thinking it is being activated on a new machine, which can cause problems if you have already maxed out your activations.

**Resolution** 

Please follow this process:

1) Uninstall Unity

2) Delete this file:

* Windows: C:ProgramData/Unity (If the files are hidden, you need to click View and tick the Hidden Items check box.)  

* Mac: Library/Application Support/Unity

3) Restart

 4) Download Unity again from our [website](http://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)  

 5) Reinstall, remembering to select ‘activate free version’ when prompted for Personal, or enter your serial number for Plus or Pro.
