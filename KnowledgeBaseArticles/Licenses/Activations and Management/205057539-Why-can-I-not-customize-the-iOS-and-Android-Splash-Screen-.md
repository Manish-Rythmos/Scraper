*   I am unable to customize the Splash Screen when building to Android and iOS devices.

**Cause** 

This is caused when:

*   The iOS Pro add-on is not attached to the serial number activated in your Unity Editor.
*   The Android Pro add-on is not attached to the serial number activated in your Unity Editor.

**Resolution** 

You can now (as of June 28th 2016) purchase a new license with Android and iOS included on our [Store](https://store.unity.com/) site. For older licenses that have not yet been migrated to the new licensing plan, please see below.

Check if the serial number activated in your Editor has the Pro Android and/or iOS Pro add-on attached. You can do this by following this process:

  1. Open the Unity Editor.

  2. Click "Unity" > "About Unity" ("Help" > "About Unity" on Windows).

This window will display the serial number, along with the features attached. See   the example below:

***If the Pro versions of the add-ons are missing:* ** 

In this case, you can purchase a new license, or migrate your old license to the new licensing system. For more information on migration, please see this [article](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/208592536).

***If the Pro versions of the add-ons are attached:* **

**More Information** 

The custom Splash Screen is the only Engine feature that the Unity 5 Personal Edition does not support.
