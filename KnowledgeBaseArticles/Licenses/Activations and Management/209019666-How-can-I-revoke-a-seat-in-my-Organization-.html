<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You need to be the Owner Manager of an Organization to manage seats.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You may wish to transfer the seat to a new user. This may be needed if, for example, a user leaves your Organization and you wish to give the seat to a different member of your Team, or a new Contractor.</p>

<ul>
<li>Click the &apos;Manage/View&apos; button on the right side of the Organization you wish to return a seat on. Please note you may only return a seat for a Organization if you are the Owner or Manager.</li>

<ul>
<li>On the next page, you will be able to remove seats from Members of your Organization. You will need to search for the Member you wish to return the license for, then click the &apos;cross&apos; marked with an &apos;X&apos; to the right of their name.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204268803/Screen_Shot_2016-05-27_at_15.48.39.png" alt="">&#xA0;<img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204268763/Screen_Shot_2016-05-27_at_15.46.24.png" alt="">&#xA0;</p>
<p>&#xA0;</p>
<p>Clicking the &apos;cross&apos; will free the seat so it can be used for a other/new member of your Organization.</p>
