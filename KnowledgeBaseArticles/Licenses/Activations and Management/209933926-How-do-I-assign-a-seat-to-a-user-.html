        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to give a new user access to my Unity Plus, Pro, or Enterprise license</li>
<li>I am the Owner or Manager of my Unity Organization</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The ability to use a license is controlled by <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/210247053" target="_blank">Seats</a>. This is a new system as of June 28th 2016. Seats must be assigned to users by the Owner or Manager of their Unity Organization in order for them to activate Unity.</p>

<li>First sign in to your Unity account on the main <a href="https://id.unity.com/account/edit" target="_blank">site</a>.

<p>A user can bring a Pro Seat of the Editor with them when collaborating on a project for another Organization, but not the Services as they are tied to the purchasing Organization. That is to say, Services can only be used on projects owned by their purchasing Organization.</p>
