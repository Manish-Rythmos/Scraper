<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This is usually due to a connectivity issue between your machine and our license servers. It can be resolved either by adjusting some of your settings, or by performing a Manual Activation.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The reason you are not getting the right SSL certificate or SSH remote key is due to&#xA0;one of the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a firewall or proxy in place which is interrupting your connection to the license server.&#xA0;Please try allowing these ports in your settings: 80 and 443.</li>
<li>You have an anti-viral software that is blocking the connection. Please try disabling this and seeing if the Editor will work.</li>
<li>You have a weak or intermittent Internet connection - this is less likely than the points above.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>If this does not solve the problem you may need to perform a Manual Activation.</p>
<p>To perform a Manual Activation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily switch off your Internet</li>
<li>Run Unity and you will be prompted to initiate the Manual Activation process.</li>
<li>Follow the steps shown in this <a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html" target="_blank">document</a>.</li>
</ul>
