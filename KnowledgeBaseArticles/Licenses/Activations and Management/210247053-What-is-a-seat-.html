        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am interested in purchasing a license, or adding more activations to my current license.</li>
<li>I can see the option to add more &apos;seats&apos; to my subscription. What does a &apos;seat&apos; mean?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Users&#xA0;who want to have more than one person within their Organization using a copy of Unity Pro will need to purchase extra &apos;seats&apos; for new users using Unity software.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>When you subscribe to Unity, you purchase a number of seats, which are <a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-use">access rights</a>&#xA0;for each person in your Organization that will be using Unity.</p>
<p>For example, if you have 10 users on your team, you need a Unity Pro subscription with 10 seats, with each seat costing $125/month.</p>
