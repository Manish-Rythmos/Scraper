*   I am an Educational license holder with many machines activated in Unity
*   I am part of a company with many licenses
*   I would like to know which machines my license is activated on

**Cause** 

If machines are being constantly re-imaged, such as in a school environment, it can be hard to keep track of your activations. We recommend that you keep your own records, but we can create a list of your activations for you if needed.

**Resolution** 

Please contact us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new) with your serial number(s) and we can create a list of your activations for your records. We can also return activations on specific machines, if needed.
