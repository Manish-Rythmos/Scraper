        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I work in an educational institution</li>
<li>I have many computers to activate</li>
<li>I am looking for a way to activate all my machines at once.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If you have a full lab of machines to activate, obviously you would like to save as much time as possible. We do not yet have a mass activation option, but silent command line activation is the fastest way to activate multiple machines.</p>
<p><strong>Resolutions</strong> </p>
<p>At the moment, we do not support activation through imaging software, so the fastest way to activate multiple machines is to use Command Line/ Terminal.</p>
<p>Please see the link<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html" target="_blank"> here</a> for guidance.</p>
<p><em>Please note, in the&#xA0;command line argument:</em> </p>
<p><em><strong>&quot;C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe&quot; -quit -batchmode -serial &lt;serial #&gt; -username &lt;account username&gt; -password &lt;password&gt;&quot;</strong> </em> </p>
<p><em>The account username is the email address, not the real username.&#xA0;</em> </p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>If you wish to return activations on your Educational License, or would like more information about Command Line activation, you can contact us <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
