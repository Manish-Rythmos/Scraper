*   I am interested in purchasing a license, or adding more activations to my current license.
*   I can see the option to add more 'seats' to my subscription. What does a 'seat' mean?

**Cause** 

Users who want to have more than one person within their Organization using a copy of Unity Pro will need to purchase extra 'seats' for new users using Unity software.

**Resolution** 

When you subscribe to Unity, you purchase a number of seats, which are [access rights](https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-use) for each person in your Organization that will be using Unity.

For example, if you have 10 users on your team, you need a Unity Pro subscription with 10 seats, with each seat costing \$125/month.

**More Information**
