*   I want to download the Unity Editor
*   I cannot find where to download Unity

**Cause** 

If you want to use Unity, you need to download the Unity Editor installer from our website. The Installer for the Unity Editor works for all license tiers.

Once you have installed the Unity Editor on your machine, you will be able to activate your license type by starting up the Editor and either typing in your serial number, or selecting the 'activate free version' when prompted.

**Resolution** 

You can download the latest Unity installer from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/update)

If you are looking to use another version of Unity, you can download older versions of Unity from the archive [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

For information on activating your Unity License then see the guide [here.](https://unity3d.com/unity/activation)
