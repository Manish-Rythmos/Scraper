*   I have not used Unity before and would like to know how to activate my license
*   I would like to activate Personal, Plus, or Pro
*   I have used Unity Personal, but would like to update the Editor to my new Plus or Pro license.

**Cause** 

There are a couple of ways to activate, depending on your network situation.

**Resolution** 

The fastest way to activate is online. Guidance for this can be found [here](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/OnlineActivationGuide.html).Â 

If you are in a secure network environment, or receive an error while activating, it may be due to a connectivity problem. Please try [Manually Activating](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html). If this does not work for you, please send the details along with screenshots of any errors received to [Support](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

If you have used Unity Personal, or a different Pro/Plus license key, in the past you need to update your Editor to input your new license details. To do this, please follow this process:

1.  Open the Unity Editor as usual
2.  Sign in with your Unity account
3.  Press the 'Unity' button (or 'Help' if you are on a Windows machine)
4.  Press 'Manage License'
5.  Select 'Activate new license' and type in your new Unity serial number.

**More Information** 

For guidance on how to locate your license serial number (Plus, Pro and Enterprise users only), please see this [article](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/209933966).
