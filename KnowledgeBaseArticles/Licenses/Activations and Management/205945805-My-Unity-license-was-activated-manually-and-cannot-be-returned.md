**Cause** 

If you cannot activate due to an inconsistent internet connection, you may need to activate manually. Doing so, you may not be able to return your license via your web account. 

**Resolution** 

In this case you will need to contact Support. We can clear the existing activations for you, making it possible to reactivate successfully.

Please get in touch with us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new).

When contacting Support, please provide your license serial number.

**More Information** 

Please read the [Manual Activation Guide](http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ManualActivationGuide.html) for further instructions on how to manually activate your license.
