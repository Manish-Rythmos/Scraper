        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am an Educational license holder with many machines activated in Unity</li>
<li>I am part of a company with many licenses</li>
<li>I would like to know which machines my license is activated on</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If machines are being constantly re-imaged, such as in a school environment, it can be hard to keep track of your activations. We recommend that you keep your own records, but we can create a list of your activations for you if needed.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Please contact us <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a> with your serial number(s) and we can create a list of your activations for your records. We can also return activations on specific machines, if needed.</p>
