*   I am trying to set up version control integration in Unity. In the Editor, if I go to  ***Window - Version Control ** * and can see this option is not available:

**Cause** 

You will need to be using a Pro license with Team License features to use Version Control.

All Unity 5.x licenses come with Team License as standard, though older licenses required an add-on. If you have a 4.x or 3.x license, you may not have the add-on.

**Resolution** 

You must have a Unity Professional License with a Team License attached to use Version Control Integration features. 

The Team License is included when you purchase a Unity 5 Professional License or Unity Professional Subscription. 

If you use the Unity 5 Editor, you will have access to the Team License.

If you are using the Unity 4 or 3 Editor, even if you have a Unity 5 Professional license, it will not give you access to the Team License function as it was a separate add-on feature in Unity 4.x

You will also need to have the Asset Server setup. You can do this via the [Setup Guide](http://unity3d.com/unity/team-license).

To enable Version Control Integration for Unity 4, you will need to speak with sales by submitting your inquiry for a team license to our sales team via this [link](http://unity3d.com/company/sales?type=sales).   

Your local sales adviser will be able to help you so set this up.

**More Information** 

Team license is slowly being replaced with [Unity Collaborate](https://unity3d.com/services/collaborate).
