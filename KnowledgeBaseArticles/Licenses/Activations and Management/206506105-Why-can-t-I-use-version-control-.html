</ul>
<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203364869/version_control.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You will need to be using a Pro license with Team License features to use Version Control.</p>
<p>All Unity 5.x licenses come with Team License as standard, though older licenses required an add-on. If you have a 4.x or 3.x license, you may not have the add-on.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You must have a Unity Professional License with a Team License attached to use Version Control Integration features.&#xA0;</p>
<p>The Team License is included when you purchase a Unity 5&#xA0;Professional License or Unity Professional Subscription.&#xA0;</p>
<p>If you use the Unity 5 Editor, you will have access to the Team License.</p>
<p>If you are using the Unity 4 or 3 Editor, even if you have a Unity 5 Professional license, it will not give you access to the Team License function as it was a separate&#xA0;add-on feature in Unity 4.x</p>
<p>You will also need to have the Asset Server setup. You can do this via the <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/team-license" target="_blank">Setup Guide</a>.</p>
<p>To enable Version Control Integration for Unity 4, you will need to speak with sales by submitting your inquiry for a team license to our sales team via this&#xA0;<a href="http://unity3d.com/company/sales?type=sales" target="_blank">link</a>. <br><br>Your local sales adviser will be able to help you so set this up.</p>
