        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to run multiple versions of Unity on my machine</li>
<li>I would like to activate multiple Unity Editor versions on the same machine</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may be developing a game using multiple versions of the Editor and need to activate several versions of the Editor on the same machine.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You can install multiple versions of the Editor on a single machine by installing them in different&#xA0;directories.</p>
<p><em><strong>Macintosh Users: </strong> </em> </p>
<p>You will be able to install multiple versions of the Editor, however you may have trouble finding them once installed if you do not rename the folders. <em> </em> When the Editor is installed, navigate to the Unity folder in Finder and rename it.</p>
<p>We also recommend that you rename the  <em>.exe</em>  file within the installation folder. There are a few people who also change the icon, which is a great idea.</p>
<p><em><strong>Windows Users:&#xA0;</strong> </em> </p>
<p>When installing the Editor, please ensure that you rename the directory that the Editor is installed to.</p>

<p>Ensure that you change this install folder name for each&#xA0;new version, otherwise the older version will be replaced.</p>
