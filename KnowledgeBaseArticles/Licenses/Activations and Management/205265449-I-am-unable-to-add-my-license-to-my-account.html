        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I&#xA0;wish to add one or many licenses to an account in order to manage them better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Standard Perpetual licenses can be managed through your Organization, though Educational licenses cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>All licenses purchased on the <a href="https://store.unity.com/" target="_blank">Store</a> from 28th June 2016 onwards, will be automatically added to your Organization during the purchasing process. For older licenses, there are a couple of answers depending on what sort of license you hold:</p>
<p><em><strong>Standard Perpetual license</strong> </em> </p>
<p>You should not have any problems when adding a standard license to an account. You can add the license to an account via the process below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go <a href="https://store.unity3d.com/account/licenses" target="_blank">here</a></li>
<li>Sign in to your Unity account</li>
<li>Click &quot;Add Existing License&quot;</li>
<li>Enter your serial number&#xA0;</li>
<li>Click &quot;Add&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>If you get the error  <em>&quot;License is already assigned. If you think this is incorrect, please contact support&quot;</em>  then you will need the support team to remove the license from the account it is currently attached to.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Get in touch with us <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.<br></p>
<p><strong><em>Educational&#xA0;license</em> </strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, Educational licenses cannot be attached to accounts. This is an added security feature exclusive for Educational licenses.</p>
<p>If you wish to upgrade your license, then you will need to speak to your local representative <a href="http://unity3d.com/sales/finder" target="_blank">here</a>. If you purchased from Studica, then you will need to speak with them.</p>
<p>If you wish to reset the activations on the license then you will need to provide the serial number in an activation reset request to Unity Support.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>When adding Company licenses to accounts, we recommend that you attach them to general accounts that a few people have access to. The reason for this is that if an employee leaves, you will still be able to access the licenses account if it is a general account.</p>
