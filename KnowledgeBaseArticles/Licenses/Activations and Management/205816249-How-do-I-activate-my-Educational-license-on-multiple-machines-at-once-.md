*   I have an Educational license  

*   I have more than one machine that I need to activate

**Cause** 

Often our Educational license holders need to activate on a full lab of machines at one time. Although this is not yet possible, we do now support batch file activation, which makes things a lot easier.  

**Resolution** 

It is not yet possible to activate more than one machine at a time. The quickest way to work through your lab is to activate silently by using this command line argument:  

C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -username name@example.gov.uk -password XXXXXXXXXXXXX -serial  E3-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX -quit  

The email and password used will be the same as your Unity web account. If you are a Lecturer/ Teacher, please create an admin account to use for your manual activation.   
Please see the attached document for more guidance and let us know if you have any further problems.

Also, please see the following tips which may help with activation too:

Please try allowing these ports: 80 and 443   

You can also try whitelisting these URLs:

    [activation.unity3d.com](http://activation.unity3d.com/)
