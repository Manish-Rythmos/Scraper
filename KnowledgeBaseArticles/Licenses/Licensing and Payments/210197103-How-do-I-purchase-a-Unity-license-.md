*   I would like to purchase a Unity License online.
*   I want to buy a Unity Subscription, but am unsure of the purchasing process.

**Cause** 

You are a developer and would like to purchase a Unity subscription. You want more information on how to purchase this license online and what options you are met with during the purchasing process.

**Resolution** 

To purchase a subscription, you should initially go to our [Store](https://store.unity.com/) page, where you will be greeted with the below options!

Here you can choose which license best suits your needs, and 'select your plan'.

Once you have selected your plan, you will see a page similar to this:

Here you can choose the number of license seats you require (the number of users that need access to the license) and choose the payment method.

On the checkout page, you can see a Summary of your purchase to the right side of the screen. This will tell you exactly what you have selected.
