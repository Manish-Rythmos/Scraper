*   I would like to know if Unity charge a royalty or per-title fee.
*   Are there any other fees such as annual or maintenance fees that I should be aware of?

**Cause** 

We are sometimes asked if we charge additional fees to our users while using Unity.

**Resolution** 

Unity does not charge any additional fees to what is already outlined in your order with us.

We do not charge on a per title basis and you do not pay royalties, or pay revenue share, even for games and applications made with the Personal Edition (free) version.

Unity also does not charge an additional annual fee, or maintenance fee for using our Editor outside of our [stated](http://unity3d.com/get-unity) licensing costs.
