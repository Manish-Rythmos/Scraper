*   I have obtained third party content made in another subscription tier of Unity and would like to know if this still works for my tier of Unity
*   I am making an asset in Unity Personal and wondering if users who are on Unity Plus, Professional or Enterprise will still be able to purchase and use my asset

**Cause** 

Developers are likely to create assets or add-ons on a different subscription tier from you. For example, a Developer may create third party content (user generated content, game mods, and Asset Store packages) within Unity Personal and you want to use this in your Unity Plus version of the Editor.

**Resolution** 

You are free to use and create third party assets irrespective of which version of the Editor the end user is on. Content developed in Unity Personal be used to create a game in Unity Plus or Pro, and vice versa.
