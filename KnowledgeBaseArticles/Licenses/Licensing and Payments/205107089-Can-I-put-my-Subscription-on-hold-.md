*   I want to put my subscription on hold.
*   I do not want to lose my subscription permanently, but do not want to restart the 12 month commitment period again.

**Causes** 

You may have run into financial difficultly and cannot afford the subscription for a few months.

The specific project you were working on may have stopped and you need to put the subscription on hold until you next find work.

**Resolutions** 

Unfortunately, subscriptions cannot be put on hold. This applies to users who are within the 12 month commitment period and part of the flexible plan.

Subscriptions are a continuous contract. They can be cancelled as part of the flexible plan, however if a new subscription is wanted, a further 12 month minimum commitment period will be necessary. There is no option to pause subscriptions.
