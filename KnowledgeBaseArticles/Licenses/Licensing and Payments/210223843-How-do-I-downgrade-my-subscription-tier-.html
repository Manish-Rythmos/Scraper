<ul>
<li>I am a Unity subscription owner</li>
<li>I would like to downgrade to a lower tier of the subscription service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We offer different tiers of subscriptions, which have different levels of access to Unity Services and different pricing levels.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>

<p>If you are within your 12 month contract, it is not possible to downgrade your subscription plan.</p>
<p>It is however, possible to upgrade your subscription to a higher tier if increased access to Unity Services is required.</p>
<p>If you wish to discuss your subscription tier, you can contact Support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>Please note that the above contractual obligation also applies to other contracted subscriptions, for example Premium Support and Source Code access.</p>
