*   My company would like to become a Reseller for Unity software in our local area.

**Cause** 

Providing you have a legitimate company, have experience in selling software and have an existing customer base, you may apply to become a Reseller for Unity products.

**Resolution** 

You may apply to become a Reseller [here](https://store.unity3d.com/reseller/become_a_reseller)

Our Reseller Team will assess your application and get in touch accordingly before moving forward.

If you have already applied via this form and have not heard back from us, then unfortunately you were not successful due to an already saturated Reseller presence in your area.
