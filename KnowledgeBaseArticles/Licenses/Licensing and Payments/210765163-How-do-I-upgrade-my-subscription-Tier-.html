<li>I own a subscription license, but want to upgrade to a higher tier</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> &#xA0;</p>
<p>You may wish to upgrade to have greater access to the Services, or due to meeting the revenue cap on your current tier.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>

<p>To upgrade a current subscription plan, please follow the steps below:</p>

<li>First log into your Unity Account at the&#xA0;<a href="https://id-staging.unity.com/">Unity website</a>.</li>
<li>Once logged in your account, click the &apos;Organizations&apos; tab on the left hand side of the screen.</li>
<li>Once in&#xA0;the Organization that owns the subscription you wish to upgrade, under the &apos;Subscriptions&apos; box, click &apos;Manage&apos; (the cog icon). You will then see a green box saying &apos;Upgrade Plan&apos;.</li>
<li>You will be then taken to a page with the packages/models available for you to upgrade to. &#xA0; </li>
</ol>
