        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am looking in my Unity account, but I cannot see a way to add seats to my license.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may have had more members join your project team and would like to add&#xA0;more seats so that they can use the&#xA0;license.</p>
<p>Only the Owner of the Unity Organization that the license was purchased on can add seats to a license. So if you cannot see a way to do this, please check who is listed as the Owner of the Organization.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To add seats to your license. Start by having the Owner sign into the account linked to the Organization <a href="https://id.unity.com/en/conversations/09998090-0b88-4d14-a7e0-f118c600e86d005f">here</a>. Then click &quot;Organizations.&quot;</p>

<p>Next, go to the Organization that has the subscription attached to it. Click &quot;Seats &amp; Services.&quot;</p>

<p>Click the &apos;Manage seats&apos; button:</p>

<p>You will then need to scroll down and click the &apos;Add more seats&quot; tab. Add however many extra seats you need and confirm the extra cost: <br></p>
