*   I have a Unity Pro license, but I need to build to mobile platforms.
*   I would like to know how I can add an add-on to an existing license.

**Cause** 

If you have a Pro license, in the past you needed to purchase iOS Pro and/or Android Pro add-ons separately to deploy to mobileÂ platforms.

**Resolution** 

As of June 28th 2016, our licenses include the iOS and Android add-ons at no extra cost. This means that if you have a Pro or Plus subscription, you can deploy to iOS and Android without an add-on.

Personal Edition users also have iOS and Android deployment included for free.

**More Information** 

You can see the full licensing options at our [Store page](https://store.unity.com/).
