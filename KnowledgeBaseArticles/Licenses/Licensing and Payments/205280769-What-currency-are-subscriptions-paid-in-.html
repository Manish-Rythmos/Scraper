        <p>&#xA0; <strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am being charged in Dollars, but I live in Europe</li>
<li>I would like to be billed for my subscription in EUR/USD/JPY/BRL/KRW/CNY</li>
<li>I do not want to pay my subscription in USD</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>There are different currencies that Unity use to bill subscription customers. The currency cannot be changed after the subscription has been set up.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The current currency options are USD, EUR, JPY, BRL, CNY and KRW.<br></p>

<p>When purchasing your Unity subscription, you can choose which currency you would like to be billed in to the bottom right of the payment plan screen. <br></p>
<p>Once you have purchased a Unity subscription however, you cannot change the currency in which you are billed in.</p>
<p>We currently only bill in these currencies to keep the billing process less complicated. Understandably, there are a huge amount of currencies not included, however these cover the largest demographic of our users.</p>
