<ul>
<li>I wish to purchase several subscriptions for my Organization</li>
<li>I would like to know if it is possible to mix different subscription tiers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unity offer different levels or &apos;tiers&apos; for our subscriptions, which means that users on different tiers have different levels of access to Services and different prices.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>As stated in our <a href="http://unity3d.com/legal/eula" target="_blank">EULA</a>, different tiers cannot be mixed together. For example Pro tier subscriptions cannot be mixed with the Personal Edition, or Personal Plus.&#xA0;</p>
<p>Due to this, customers should not own subscriptions on different tiers.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>To see the different Subscription tiers available, please go to our <a href="https://store.unity.com/" target="_blank">Store</a> page.</p>
