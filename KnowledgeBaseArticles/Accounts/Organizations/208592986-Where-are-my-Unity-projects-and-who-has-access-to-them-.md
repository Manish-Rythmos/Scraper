**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span>** 

*   I have added a Project to my Organization and would like to know who has access to the Project files
*   I am part of a group of Developers that all need access to a particular Project

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

Our system is cloud-based, which means that Unity Projects can be stored in 'Organizations'.

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

Projects are stored within your Organization.

If you are an individual Developer, only you will have access to your Organization. If you are part of a team however, anyone that has been made a member of your team's Organization will have access to the Projects stored in that Organization.

If you are working with Contractors, it is possible to give a user access to a particular project through the Editor without sharing your full Unity Organization with them. Those Contractors will then have access to everything in that Project, but not to other projects in your Organization.

You can also add users to particular Projects through the [developer.cloud.unity3d.com](http://developer.cloud.unity3d.com) Project Home -> Users interface. This will not give them access to the rest of your Organization.
