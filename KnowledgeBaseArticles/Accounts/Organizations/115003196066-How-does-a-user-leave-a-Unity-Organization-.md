**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** Â 

As a Unity user, you may be listed as a User, Manager or an Owner of an Organization. As an Owner of an Organization, you are able to remove team members, however, as a User and Manager, you are still able to leave an Organization of your own accord.
