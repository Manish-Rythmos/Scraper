<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a Unity account user and would like to know what my &apos;Organization&apos; is</li>
<li>I have heard that my Projects/ licenses will be associated with my Organization and would like to know what that means</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>When you open a Unity Account, Unity automatically creates a default &#x201C;Organization&#x201D; under your account. This default Organization has the same name as your account username. Developers that do not have their own Studio can use their default Organization when they make purchases, or open a profile on MWU. You can always add new Organizations to your Unity account. For example if you are the Head of a Studio, you can add your Studio name as an Organization, and eventually invite other people (such as the Developers working at your Studio, or freelancers you collaborate with on Projects) to your Organization.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>

<p>Organizations are a way of organizing your Projects and licenses through our website. License purchases are done through your Organization. This means that if you are part of a Company, your licenses can be kept under a Company Organization within Unity. The benefit of this is that if your account manager leaves their job, everyone on your Team will still have the access they need.</p>
<p>You can also add Projects to your Organization to make them accessible to others in your Team easily.</p>
There are a number of administrative tasks you can perform using your Organizations, including:
<ul>
<li>Assigning and revoking seats to members in your Organization.</li>
<li>Controlling access to some Cloud-based features. Based on their job/function, you can assign each member access rights, for example, giving your Marketing Team access to see how much revenue a game generates in Unity Ads.</li>
<li>Controlling access to Cloud Build projects within your Organization. You can organize members of your Organization into separate groups in which the members of a given group have access to specific Cloud Build Projects.</li>
</ul>
