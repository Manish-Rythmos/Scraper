*   I am an Owner, Manager or a User for a Unity Organization
*   I would like to know what administrative rights different user types have in my Unity Organization.

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

As a member of an Organization, you will have different administrative rights depending on whether you are an Owner, Manager, or a User. Different roles give access to certain levels within in the Organization. 

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

Owners access all settings in any of their Organizations' subscriptions, across all projects. Owners are the only users who have access to the payment instruments, invoices and billing data at the Organization level.

Managers can access most settings in any of their subscriptions, across all projects. Managers can add users, access Unity Ads revenue data, and do almost everything an Owner can do. They cannot however see billing and credit card information for the Organization.

Users can only read and view data (with the exception of Ads revenue data), not edit it.

If you are an Owner or Manager, you can manage and change settings in the Organization(s) you are a member of. To do this, first log into the main Unity website [here](https://id.unity.com).

Once logged in, click the Organizations option to the left.
