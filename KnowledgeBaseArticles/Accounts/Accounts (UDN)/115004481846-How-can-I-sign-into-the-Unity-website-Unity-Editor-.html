        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to sign in to the Unity Editor to use the software/ make an Asset Store purchase or download.</li>
<li>I would like to sign into the Unity website so that I can manage my personal details, licenses, post on the Forums, or make a license purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>The Unity Editor and website require an account to be used for access.<br></span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>You can sign into both the Unity Editor and the Unity website using a Unity ID account, created <a href="https://id.unity.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. You can also use this page to sign in if you already have an account.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use your Facebook or Google (Gmail) account to create an account for your email address. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Facebook/ Google login option on the sign in page</li>
<li>A pop-up for Facebook/ Google will appear. Click &quot;Continue&quot;</li>
<li>Enter your Facebook/ Google account details to sign in.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>More Information</strong> </span></p>
<p>If you sign in with a Facebook/ Google account with an email that already has a Unity account, you will be asked for your Unity password to link the two accounts together. This avoids any confusion that having multiple accounts might cause.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>
<p>If your Facebook account is not confirmed, or you did not allow Unity to receive your Facebook account email, then the sign in will fail. The solution for this issue is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try again after your Facebook account is confirmed</li>
<li>Go to Facebook, under Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Logged in with Facebook&gt;Unity and make sure email is checked</li>
</ul>
