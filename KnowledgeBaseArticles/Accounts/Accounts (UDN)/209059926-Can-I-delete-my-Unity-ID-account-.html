<ul>
<li>I do not want my Unity ID account any more.&#xA0;</li>
<li>I wish to delete my Unity ID account.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>You are no longer using Unity and do not need the account. You may have multiple accounts and no longer wish to use one of them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible for users to delete their own Unity ID accounts at this time. You can <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new%20" target="_blank">contact us</a> to disable accounts however. This means that the account will no longer be accessible. Please make sure the request is coming from the e-mail linked to the account.&#xA0;</p>
