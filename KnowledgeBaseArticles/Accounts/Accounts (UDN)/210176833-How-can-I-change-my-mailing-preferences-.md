To change mailing preferences simply go to the Unity 'sign in' page on this following [link](https://id.unity.com/) and log in.

Once logged in you will be on the 'My Account Settings' page.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and you will find 'Email Preferences' under the heading 'Communications', then click the 'Edit' button to the far right:

The next screen will take you to 'My profile Page', under the heading 'Email Permissions' you will be able to tick boxes on the specific topics and groups you may wish to hear news from via your Unity email account.

Once you have selected which topics to receive emails from, select your preferred language from the drop down box at the bottom of the screen and click 'Submit'.
