        <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to change my Organization&apos;s billing details</li>
<li>I would like my subscription/ assets to be purchased from a different Bank/ Paypal account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> &#xA0;</p>
<p>There are two processes to change billing details depending on when the subscription was taken out, pre- and post-June 28th 2016. Depending on when your license was purchased, you may have to use a different process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p><em><strong>Licenses purchased before 28th June 2016:</strong> </em> </p>
<p>You can change your subscription billing details through the web account attached to the subscription; that is to say, the Unity account on which the subscription was purchased. Here is the process to follow:</p>
<p>1. Go here: <a class="external-link" href="https://accounts.unity3d.com/sign-in" rel="nofollow">https://accounts.unity3d.com/sign-in</a><br>2. Log in to the account attached to the subscription <br>3. Go here: <a class="external-link" href="https://store.unity3d.com/" rel="nofollow">https://store.unity3d.com/</a><br>4. Click &apos;My Account&apos;<br>5. Click billing details<br>6. Change details and save.</p>
<p><strong><em>Licenses purchased after 28th June 2016, or migrated to a post-June 28th subscription plan:</em> </strong> </p>
<p>Your billing details can be changed through the purchasing Organization</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Log into your account: https://id.unity.com</span></li>
<li><span>Click &quot;Organizations on the left side of the screen.<br></span></li>
<li><span>Select the organization used upon purchase of the subscription/license<br></span></li>
<li><span>Click &quot;Edit Organization&quot;<br></span></li>
<li><span>Change the billing details in the next screen and save.</span></li>
</ol>
