*   I do not want my Unity ID account any more. 
*   I wish to delete my Unity ID account.

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

You are no longer using Unity and do not need the account. You may have multiple accounts and no longer wish to use one of them.

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

Unfortunately, it is not possible for users to delete their own Unity ID accounts at this time. You can [contact us](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new%20) to disable accounts however. This means that the account will no longer be accessible. Please make sure the request is coming from the e-mail linked to the account.

If you would like to be removed from our mailing list, please state this so that we can add the e-mail to our blocked list.
