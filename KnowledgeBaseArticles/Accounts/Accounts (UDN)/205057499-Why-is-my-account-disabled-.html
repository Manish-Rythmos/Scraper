<ul>
<li>I am unable to sign in to my Unity account<br></li>
<li>I receive a message telling me that my account has been disabled</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>There are a few reasons why an account may be disabled:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Finance Team may disable an account that has suspect card use on it.</li>
<li>The Asset Store Team may also disable an account due to fraudulent behaviour, or use of file-sharing sites.</li>
<li>The Community Managers may disable accounts that are Spam accounts, or display abusive behaviour</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>If your account has been disabled, you can contact us to find out the reason.</p>
