        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have spelt&#xA0;my username incorrectly</li>
<li>I&#xA0;wish to change my&#xA0;username</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>It could be that you have just created an account and realised that your username choice was wrong. Or perhaps, your name or company name has changed meaning that you need to alter it.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>Users are not able to change their usernames themselves, however we do allow you to change them through us. You will need to send the following information to the support team:</p>
<ul>
<li>E-mail address attached to the account.</li>
<li>New Username.</li>
<li>Alternate New Username.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can contact Support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
