        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I have not received my confirmation email.</li>
<li>I cannot log into my newly created account.</li>
<li>I am receiving an invalid email address error.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>We all make mistakes sometimes and the misspelling of &apos;gmail&apos; as &apos;gmial&apos; is far more common that you might think!</p>
<p>The misspelling of an email address during account creation means that we cannot send out your confirmation email. This therefore, stops you from being able to confirm your account and use Unity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>Please contact Support <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a>&#xA0;and we will be able to correct your email address for you. You will need to provide your Unity username, in order for us to track down your account without the correct email.</p>
<p>Another solution is to create a new account with the correct email address and an alternative username. You can then contact us to delete your old account.</p>
