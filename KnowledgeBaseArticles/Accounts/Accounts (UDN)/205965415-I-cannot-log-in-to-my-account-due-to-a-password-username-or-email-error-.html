<li>I am trying to reset my password and keep getting the error  <em>&quot;Invalid email&quot;</em> </li>

<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p><strong>If you receive&#xA0;the error&#xA0; <em>&quot;Reset password token is invalid&quot;:</em> </strong> &#xA0;</p>
<p>This is because you&#xA0;have not&#xA0;copied the URL link provided in the token reset email correctly into your browser or you are using a different&#xA0;email client.</p>
<p><strong>If you receive the error  <em>&quot;Username is invalid&quot;:</em> </strong> </p>
<p>This is because our&#xA0;accounts server fails to recognize a <span class="il">username</span> with uncommon characters such as &quot;@!?.#()&quot;. In nearly all cases the user will need to change their Username to something valid so as not to confuse the system.</p>
<p><strong>If you have received the error  <em>&quot;Email is invalid&quot;:</em> </strong> &#xA0;</p>
<p>This is because the email address is being entered incorrectly. You will need to make sure you are typing the email address all in lower case.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>To make sure your reset password token is valid, you will need to make sure you are copying the URL correctly and using the correct email client.</p>
