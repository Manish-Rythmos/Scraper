<ul>
<li><span>I have purchased an asset</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>If your duplicate invoice(s) are within a few minutes of your original invoice, this may be due to one of these factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>a server error at our end</span></li>
<li><span>a server error at the Bank&#x2019;s end</span></li>
<li><span>a dip in your Internet connection at the time of purchase</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Please contact us <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a></span><span> with your two invoice numbers (the numbers beginning with &#x2018;3&#x2019; at the top right side of your invoice).
