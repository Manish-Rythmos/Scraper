        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I cannot access the invoices for my Asset Store purchases.</span></li>
<li><span>Is there a way that I can access the invoices myself?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Causes</strong> </span></p>
<p>It may be that you no longer have access to the email account your original invoices were sent to. Perhaps you are part of a company and the invoices have been sent to a colleague.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolutions</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Your Asset Store invoices will be sent to the email address attached to the Unity account that purchased the asset. You will be able to retrieve the invoice from this email account<br></span></p>
<p><span>You can also email our Support Team <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span><span>. Please let us know the email address that purchased the asset, as well as the name of the asset(s).</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, there is no way for users to access Asset Store invoices en mass themselves unless it is through their email account. </span></p>
