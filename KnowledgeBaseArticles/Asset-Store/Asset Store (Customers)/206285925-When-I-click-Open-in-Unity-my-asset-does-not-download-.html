        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I have purchased an asset and received my PDF Unity invoice confirming my purchase.</span></li>
<li><span>When I click &#x2018;Open in Unity&#x2019; to trigger the download, it does not work.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>This is usually a problem to do with connectivity, but rarely can also be due to a server error at our end.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes sites that will open perfectly within your browser are blocked from opening within Unity by proxies, firewalls, or anti-viral software.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, please try downloading the asset from within the Editor by following this process:<br></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Unity Engine.</span></li>
<li><span>Click &quot;Window&quot; &gt; &quot;Asset Store&quot;.</span></li>
<li><span>Log in</span></li>
<li><span>Find Asset.</span></li>
<li><span>Click the &#x2018;buy&#x2019; button. If you have already purchased, there will be an option to download or import.</span></li>
<li><span>Download Asset.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>If this does not work for you, it could be a connectivity issue. Please test your connectivity by following these suggestions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>If you have a firewall, or proxy running go into the settings and allow these ports: 80 and 443</span></li>
<li><span>If you have an anti-viral software running, please temporarily disable it and see if that allows the asset to download</span></li>
<li><span>If you have a weak, or intermittent Internet connection, assets will not be downloaded. Please be aware of this when purchasing assets.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>If none of the above are true for your machine/ network, please contact us <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank">here</a></span><span> in case there is a problem with the asset, or with our servers. </span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>More Information</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>Once assets have been downloaded, they can also be found in the following directory:<br>Windows - User&gt;AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Unity&gt; Asset Store<br>Mac - User&gt;Library&gt;Unity&gt;Asset Store</span></p>
