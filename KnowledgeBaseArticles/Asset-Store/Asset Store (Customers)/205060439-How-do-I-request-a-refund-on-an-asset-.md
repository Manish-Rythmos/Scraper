*   I have accidentally purchased the wrong asset from the store.
*   I have purchased an asset that doesÂ not work as described.
*   I have a duplicate purchase.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Cause** </span>

Duplicate purchases may be caused by server errors, or a blip in connectivity locally. These can be refunded by us, though other types of refund request must go through the Publisher of the asset.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

If you have made a duplicate purchase, please contact us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new), so that we can process your refund.

For all other refund requests, please contact the Publisher of the asset directly. They can then support you, or may offer a refund at their discretion.
