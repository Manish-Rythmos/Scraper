*   I have contacted the Publisher of an asset and they have authorised a refund of the asset with Unity
*   I have not yet received the funds back in my bank account

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Cause** </span>

It can take a while for funds to transfer from our Bank to yours - this is dependent on the Banks' method of processing transfers.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

Assuming that the Publisher of the asset has given us his/ her authorisation to process the refund, it can take some time to transfer the funds over.

Please allow 10 days for the funds to be transferred to your account. If it has been more than 10 days since the publisher has authorized your refund with us, please contact us [here](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we will check on the progress of the payment.

Funds will be transferred to the purchasing account. If you used Paypal for your purchase, the funds will be refunded there rather than in your Bank account.
