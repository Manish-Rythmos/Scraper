*   <span>I have purchased an asset and received my PDF Unity invoice confirming my purchase.</span>
*   <span>When I click ‘Open in Unity’ to trigger the download, it does not work.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Cause** </span>

<span>This is usually a problem to do with connectivity, but rarely can also be due to a server error at our end.</span>

<span>Sometimes sites that will open perfectly within your browser are blocked from opening within Unity by proxies, firewalls, or anti-viral software.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

<span>Firstly, please try downloading the asset from within the Editor by following this process:  
</span>

1.  <span>Open Unity Engine.</span>
2.  <span>Click "Window" > "Asset Store".</span>
3.  <span>Log in</span>
4.  <span>Find Asset.</span>
5.  <span>Click the ‘buy’ button. If you have already purchased, there will be an option to download or import.</span>
6.  <span>Download Asset.</span>

<span>If this does not work for you, it could be a connectivity issue. Please test your connectivity by following these suggestions:</span>

1.  <span>If you have a firewall, or proxy running go into the settings and allow these ports: 80 and 443</span>
2.  <span>If you have an anti-viral software running, please temporarily disable it and see if that allows the asset to download</span>
3.  <span>If you have a weak, or intermittent Internet connection, assets will not be downloaded. Please be aware of this when purchasing assets.</span>

<span>If none of the above are true for your machine/ network, please contact us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new)</span><span> in case there is a problem with the asset, or with our servers. </span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**More Information** </span>

<span>Once assets have been downloaded, they can also be found in the following directory:  
Windows - User>AppData>Roaming>Unity> Asset Store  
Mac - User>Library>Unity>Asset Store</span>
