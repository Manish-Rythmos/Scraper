*   <span>I would like to purchase an asset with a voucher</span>
*   <span>I would like to purchase an asset for someone else by giving them a voucher</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Cause** </span>

<span>Since Assets are linked to accounts you cannot make purchases on behalf of another user/customer so a workaround would be to purchase a voucher.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

<span>You will need to contact the [Sales Team](https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales) to purchase a voucher.   
</span>

Once you have made your purchase, the voucher amount will be added to your Asset Store account. You can then use the balance to purchase assets.

Please note: If you are purchasing a voucher for someone else to use, you must ensure that you give the Sales Team their account details - the email address they use to access Unity - so that the voucher is set up on the correct account.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**More Information** </span>

<span>Please note: There is usually a \$1000 minimum on voucher purchases, but your salesperson can give you more information on this.</span>
