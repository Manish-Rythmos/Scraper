Invoices are usually generated and sent out automatically when we receive payment. It may be that your invoice has been caught by your Spam filters, or has been delayed by an error.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

Initially, please check your spam filters or junk folders. We will always send through a confirmation email with a PDF invoice when your purchase has come through.

If you cannot locate the confirmation email in these folders, please get in touch with us [here](/hc/en-us/requests/new) and we will check what has happened to your purchase.
