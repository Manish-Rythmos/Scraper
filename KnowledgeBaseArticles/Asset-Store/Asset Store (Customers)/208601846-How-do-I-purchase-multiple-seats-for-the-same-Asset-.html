<ul>
<li>Can someone on my team use an Asset I have purchased?</li>
<li>How many people can use the same Asset?</li>
<li>Can I share an asset I have purchased with someone who has not purchased it?</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>Wanting to know if other team members/people outside their company are able to use Assets they have purchased and or buying an Asset and allowing another person to use the Asset.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>If you are buying an Editor Extension, you will be required to purchase multiple seats for the asset if multiple users will be using it.</p>
<p>When purchasing the Editor Extension you will be able to change the quantity via the shopping cart. This number represents the quantity of seats and the asset&#x2019;s cost is per seat.</p>
<p>If you already own the Editor Extension, but need to purchase more seats you can do so. First, ensure that you are logged into the account you used to purchase the asset, then open up the Asset Store and find the asset.</p>
<p>There will be a download button on the asset page, when you click this, an option will be displayed, allowing you to purchase more seats by changing the quantity.&#xA0;</p>

<p>Once you have purchased multiple seats (copies) of an Asset you can allow team members/others to use the Asset without any issues.</p>
