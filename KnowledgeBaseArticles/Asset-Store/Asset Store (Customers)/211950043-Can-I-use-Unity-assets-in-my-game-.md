*   I have seen a Unity created asset that I think would be great for my project
*   I want to know if I could use Unity's assets for my commercial game

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

Unity occasionally create tutorials and showcases for new features that involve assets created by ourselves to demonstrate what the article/tutorial is showing. We often release these assets to the Community for users to see for themselves how they function, or use them when completing tutorials.

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

It is legally fine to use Unity's assets, according to our Licensing.

We recommend you do not use them in commercial games and content however, since assets in our tutorial and example projects are well known. They are intended for use in non-commercial content for educational purposes only.

Please note: Assets on our Asset Store may not be resold.Â
