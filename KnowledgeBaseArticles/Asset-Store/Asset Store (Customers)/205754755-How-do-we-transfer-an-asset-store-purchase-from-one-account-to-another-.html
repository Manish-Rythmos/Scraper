        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I need to share an asset with another developer on my team</li>
<li>I would like to consolidate all my asset purchases into one Unity account</li>
<li>We have purchased assets on an ex-employee&apos;s account and need to move the assets to a central account</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>There are a few reasons why you may wish to move assets between accounts, whether for administrative or personal reasons. Unfortunately, for security reasons, asset purchases are attached to the purchasing account, so it is not possible to transfer them.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to transfer purchased assets from one account to another.</p>
<p>Please see the article <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/205106909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for more information on what you can do to preserve your asset purchases.</p>
