<p>The Unity <span class="doc-keyword">Asset Store</span> is home to a growing library of free and commercial assets created both by Unity Technologies and also members of the Community. A wide variety of assets is available, covering everything from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. The assets are accessed from a simple interface built into the Unity Editor and are downloaded and imported directly into your project.</p>

<p>You can browse and purchase Assets on the Asset Store in two ways:</p>
<p>1. Open the Asset Store through the Unity Editor itself by going through the following actions:</p>
<p>&apos;Window&apos; &gt; &apos;Asset Store&apos;. Or simply press (Command + 9) or (Ctrl + 9).</p>

<p>This will open the Asset Store window and allow simple browsing of Assets. There is also a search box function if you know the specific Asset you are searching for.</p>
