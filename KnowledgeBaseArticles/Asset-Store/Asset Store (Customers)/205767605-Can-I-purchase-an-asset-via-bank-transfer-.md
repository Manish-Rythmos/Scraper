*   <span>I want to purchase an asset</span>
*   <span>I do not have a PayPal account</span>
*   <span>My credit card will not work in the asset store website</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Cause** </span>

<span>Certain countries have restrictions on PayPal and credit card accounts that do not allow them to send money outside of their country.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

<span>You can absolutely pay for an asset via a bank transfer, but there is a bit of a process to it!</span>

<span>Please follow this process to purchase your asset:</span>

1.  <span>Go to the Sales Contact page [here](https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales).</span>
2.  <span>Email them to request an asset purchase via bank transfer. You will need to give them the Asset’s name and price as well.</span>
3.  <span>They will sell you a voucher, which you will pay for by bank transfer. </span>
4.  <span>The voucher will appear on your Asset Store account upon your next sign-in. You can cash it in during checkout to purchase the asset.</span>

Please note: If you are purchasing a voucher for someone else to use, you must ensure that you give the sales team their account details - the email address they use to access Unity - so that the voucher is set up on the correct account.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**More Information** </span>

<span>There is usually a \$1000 minimum on voucher purchases, but your salesperson can give you more information on this.</span>
