*   <span>I have more than one Unity account</span>
*   <span>I would like to merge the accounts</span>
*   <span>I would like to have all my assets on one account</span>

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

<span>It is possible for users to make more than one account. For example one account on a work email address and one on a personal one. </span>

<span>You may have several people at one company wishing to use the same assets.</span>

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

<span>Unfortunately, there is no way to merge accounts, or to transfer assets from one account to another.</span>

<span>The best thing to do is put the asset files into a secure shared area, where they can be dragged and dropped into projects. Please follow the steps below to do this:  
</span>

<span>1) Open Unity software and make sure you are logged in with the purchasing account</span>

<span>2) Find and download the asset (Hit the buy button - if you are in the purchasing account, it will then give you the option to download)</span>

<span>3) Once the download is complete, the assets' files can be found in these locations:</span>

*   Windows - User>AppData>Roaming>Unity> Asset Store
*   Mac - User>Library>Unity>Asset Store

3) Drag and drop the assets' files into a shared area. This might be an area within your secure network, or a Dropbox which only your employees have access to

4) Employees or co-workers can then download the assets for use in their projects by dragging and dropping them from the shared area into their open Unity project

<span>Please note: Updates to the assets must be done through the purchasing account.</span>
