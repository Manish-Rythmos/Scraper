*   <span>I have purchased an asset and have received my PDF invoice</span>
*   <span>I cannot download the asset.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Cause** </span>

<span>Assets are not automatically downloaded upon purchase, you need to login to the Unity Editor and find the asset to download it.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

<span>Assets are downloaded through the Unity Editor. Please follow this process:</span>

1.  <span> Open Unity Editor.</span>
2.  <span> Click "Window" > "Asset Store".</span>
3.  <span> Log in</span>
4.  <span> Find Asset.</span>
5.  <span> Click the ‘buy’ button. If you have already purchased, there will be an option to download or import.</span>
6.  <span> Download Asset.</span>

<span>If your asset begins to download, but stops halfway through the process, this could be due to one of these connection issues:</span>

*   <span>You have a firewall or proxy in place, which is blocking the connection to the server. Try allowing these ports in your settings: 80 and 443</span>
*   <span>You have an anti-viral software running. Please try disabling this and hopefully the asset will finish its download</span>
*   <span>You have a weak, or intermittent Internet connection. You can check your connection through many speed check sites such as </span>[Speed Test](http://www.speedtest.net/).
