Sometimes, transactions can fail during the purchasing process. This can be frustrating when you want to purchase something at a certain time. This transaction failure can be for a variety of reasons, however, it may be that you recieve a 'declined' message, even though you are certain that your card should be avaliable for use.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

If you are having problems purchasing an asset on the Asset Store, firstly, check that the billing details listed on your Unity account, match those of you Credit Card. This includes your address, postal/zip code and country.

Also make sure that there is nothing blocking the purchase on your own machine set up.

If you are still having problems after attempting the above, try using PayPal as an alternative payment method. This can often be a successful and easy payment form to use!
