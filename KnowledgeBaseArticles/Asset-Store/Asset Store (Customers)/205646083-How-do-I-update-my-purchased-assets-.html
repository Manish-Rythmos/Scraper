<ul>
<li>I have purchased some assets that have since been updated</li>
<li>I would like to know how to update my purchased assets</li>
<li>I have updated my version of Unity and would like to update an asset I have purchased so it is compatible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>Just as we release patches to update Unity itself, our Publishers also release updates for their assets. This might be for bug-fixing, or to increase compatibility with new versions. Either way, it may be beneficial to you to update your purchased assets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>If there is an update available for any of your purchased assets, you can update them by following this process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Unity software</li>
<li>Open the Asset Store Window (Window&gt;Asset Store)</li>
<li>Click the &apos;Toggle Download Manager&apos; button, which is the 5th from the left in the Asset Store Window</li>
<li>Locate the package within your &apos;Packages&apos; tab</li>
<li>If it needs to be updated, there will be a yellow &apos;Update&apos; button to the left of the window.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">More Information</span></strong> </p>
