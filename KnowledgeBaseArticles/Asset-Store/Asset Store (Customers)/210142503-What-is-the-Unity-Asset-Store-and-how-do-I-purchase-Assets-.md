The Unity <span class="doc-keyword">Asset Store</span> is home to a growing library of free and commercial assets created both by Unity Technologies and also members of the Community. A wide variety of assets is available, covering everything from textures, models and animations to whole project examples, tutorials and Editor extensions. The assets are accessed from a simple interface built into the Unity Editor and are downloaded and imported directly into your project.

You can browse and purchase Assets on the Asset Store in two ways:

1. Open the Asset Store through the Unity Editor itself by going through the following actions:
