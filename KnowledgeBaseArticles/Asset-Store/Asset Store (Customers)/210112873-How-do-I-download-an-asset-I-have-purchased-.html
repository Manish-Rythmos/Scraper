<ul>
<li>I would like to know how&#xA0;to&#xA0;download an asset I have purchased</li>
<li>I have not been sent a download link for my asset purchase</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>You may find that after purchasing an asset via the Asset Store that you have not received a download link or product key.</p>
<p>This can make it unclear on how you can download an asset you have just purchased.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>The Unity Asset Store does not use download links. Assets can only be&#xA0;downloaded via the Unity Editor and you will need ensure that you are logged into the account that the asset was purchased on.</p>
<p>Please see the steps below on how to download Assets once successfully purchased:</p>
<p>1. Open the Unity Engine software.</p>
<p>2. Click &quot;Window&quot; &gt; &quot;Asset Store&quot;.</p>
<p>3. Log in</p>
<p>4. Find Asset.</p>
<p>5. Click the &#x2018;buy&#x2019; button. If you have already purchased, there will be an option to download or import.</p>
<p>6. Download Asset.</p>
<p>Once assets have been downloaded, they can also be found in the following directory:</p>
<p>Windows - User&gt;AppData&gt;Roaming&gt;Unity&gt; Asset Store<br>Mac - User&gt;Library&gt;Unity&gt;Asset Store</p>
<p>If you are not able to reveal the &apos;download&apos; or &apos;import&apos; buttons upon pressing the &apos;buy&apos; button, this means that your purchase has not gone through.</p>
