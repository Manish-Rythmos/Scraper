        <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have seen a Unity created asset that I think would be great for my project</li>
<li>I want to know if I could use Unity&apos;s assets for my commercial game</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>Unity occasionally create tutorials and showcases for new features that involve assets created by ourselves to demonstrate what the article/tutorial is showing. We often release these assets to the Community for users to see for themselves how they function, or use them when completing tutorials.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>It is legally fine to use Unity&apos;s assets, according to our Licensing.</p>
<p>We recommend you do not use them in commercial games and content however, since assets in our tutorial and example projects are well known. They are intended for use in non-commercial content for educational purposes only.</p>
<p>Please note: Assets on our Asset Store may not be resold.&#xA0;</p>
