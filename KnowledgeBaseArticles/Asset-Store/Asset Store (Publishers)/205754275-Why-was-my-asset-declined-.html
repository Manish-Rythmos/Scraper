        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>My asset has been declined from the Asset Store</li>
<li>I would like more feedback to understand why my asset has been declined</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Cause</strong> </span></p>
<p>The Asset Review team have high standards for assets sold on our Asset Store. As a result, they cannot accept every asset that is submitted.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolution</strong> </span></p>
<p>The Review Team usually give specific feedback via email. If you have not received a clear reason why your asset has been declined, it may be due to one of these common reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is already an asset similar to yours on the store. We want to encourage diversity on our Store as much as possible.</li>
<li>The art style needs work as it does not currently meet our standards. We want to host the best possible assets for our users.</li>
<li>Your asset does not meet the <a href="http://unity3d.com/asset-store/sell-assets/submission-guidelines#package-manager" target="_blank">submission guidelines</a>. Please review these to be sure that you have included all necessary files</li>
</ul>
