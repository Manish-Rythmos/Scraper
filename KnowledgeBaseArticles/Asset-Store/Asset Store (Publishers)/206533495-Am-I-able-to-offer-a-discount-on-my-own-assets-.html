        <p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Symptoms</strong> </span></p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to offer a discount on my asset</li>
<li><span>Am I allowed to offer a discount on my asset outside of the official Asset Store sales?</span></li>
<li><span>What changes can I make to my asset to display the discount?</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Causes</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>You would like to lower the price of your existing asset. This could be part of a plan to increase sales, or as part of a deal you would like to offer to your customers.</span></p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolutions</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>You are able to personally discount your assets on the Asset Store. There are however, rules in doing so.</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, the only place you can state the discount is in the descriptive text of the asset. Any changes to artwork, such as banners or logos that draw attention to a separate &apos;Sale&apos; to the Unity Asset Store&apos;s own sales, are prohibited.</span></p>
<p><span>You can change the price of your asset via your Publisher administrator account. This will be reviewed by the Asset Store team similarly to a new update. If they approve the price update, it will appear on the Store.</span></p>
