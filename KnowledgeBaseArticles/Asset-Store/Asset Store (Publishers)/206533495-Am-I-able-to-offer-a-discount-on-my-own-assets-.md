*   I would like to offer a discount on my asset
*   <span>Am I allowed to offer a discount on my asset outside of the official Asset Store sales?</span>
*   <span>What changes can I make to my asset to display the discount?</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Causes** </span>

<span>You would like to lower the price of your existing asset. This could be part of a plan to increase sales, or as part of a deal you would like to offer to your customers.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolutions** </span>

<span>You are able to personally discount your assets on the Asset Store. There are however, rules in doing so.</span>

<span>Firstly, the only place you can state the discount is in the descriptive text of the asset. Any changes to artwork, such as banners or logos that draw attention to a separate 'Sale' to the Unity Asset Store's own sales, are prohibited.</span>

<span>You can change the price of your asset via your Publisher administrator account. This will be reviewed by the Asset Store team similarly to a new update. If they approve the price update, it will appear on the Store.</span>
