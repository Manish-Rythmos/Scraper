*   I am thinking about applying to be part of a Sale or Deal on the Asset Store
*   I would like to know how I can increase my chances of being accepted as part of an Asset Store Sale

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

Each month Unity Asset Store runs a chain of 24 hour sales in which a single package is on sale for… 24 hours! In addition, some months feature theme sales or Madness Sales - the biggest and greatest sales of the year. Sales last from 24 hours to a full month.  
Sales items receive a large amount of publicity and - of course - significant sale numbers.   
Each month we select a number of packages to feature in our sales. Our selection criteria are dynamic, as in ever changing, but a few guidelines are pretty stationary. 

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

To be selected assets must:

*   Be highly rated by users at 4 or 5 stars. Great reviews from genuine customers are an additional blessing.
*   Be regularly updated and deliver adequate customer support.
*   Have a certain level of wide appeal. For example, one-eyed spotted alien reindeer will respectfully be surpassed.
*   Have great key images! We cannot stress enough the value of this. Whether we like it or not, the visual aspect is of significant importance when promoting your asset - both in and out of a sale. See this [PDF](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/docs/Asset_Store_Promotional_Asset_Guidelines.pdf) for more info on key images.
