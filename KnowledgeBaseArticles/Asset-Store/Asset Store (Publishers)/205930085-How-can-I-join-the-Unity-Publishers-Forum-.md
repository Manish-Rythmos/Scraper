*   <span>I am an Asset Store Publisher</span>
*   <span>I want to network with other Publishers</span>
*   <span>I would like to get tips from other Publishers</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Cause** </span>

The Publishers' Forum can be a good way to network with other Publishers and receive tips about asset or app publishing.

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

<span>Unity has a Private sub-Forum for its Publishers.   
</span>

The Forum is private to ensure it is a secure area for Publishers to discuss topics openly, but all established Asset Store Publishers are welcome.Â  To gain access, you have to have permission from the Forum Administrators. <span>You can apply for access [here](https://goo.gl/forms/5yai5oJdfriVn6w93).</span>
