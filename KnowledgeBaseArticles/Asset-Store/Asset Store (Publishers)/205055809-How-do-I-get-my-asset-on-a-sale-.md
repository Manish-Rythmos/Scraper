*   I want to promote my asset to increase my sales
*   I would like more users to see what my asset has to offer them
*   I want to give my asset away for a cheap price for a limited time

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

Sales can increase user purchases of an asset, or attract new users, however it can be a little unclear on how to get on these deals.

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

If you would like your asset to be included, please apply to join a sale via the [Sales Application Form](https://docs.google.com/a/unity3d.com/forms/d/1eL91dQ2uttWV0hyIPjiYizP98BIxQOfrNx95NfJiLqI/viewform).

You can request to be included in a specific sale in the comments box at the bottom of the form. Our Review Team will then decide which assets to put on sale.

It may be some time before your asset is included, as we receive many requests and want to ensure that the promotions include the best assets possible.
