<ul>
<li>I am thinking about applying to be part of a Sale or Deal on the Asset Store</li>
<li>I would like to know how I can increase my chances of being accepted as part of an Asset Store Sale</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>Each month Unity Asset Store runs a chain of 24 hour sales in which a single package is on sale for&#x2026; 24 hours! In addition, some months feature theme sales or Madness Sales - the biggest and greatest sales of the year. Sales last from 24 hours to a full month.<br>Sales items receive a large amount of publicity and - of course - significant sale numbers. <br>Each month we select a number of packages to feature in our sales. Our selection criteria are dynamic, as in ever changing, but a few guidelines are pretty stationary.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>To be selected assets must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be highly rated by users at 4 or 5 stars. Great reviews from genuine customers are an additional blessing.</li>
<li>Be regularly updated and deliver adequate customer support.</li>
<li>Have a certain level of wide appeal. For example, one-eyed spotted alien reindeer will respectfully be surpassed.</li>
<li>Have great key images! We cannot stress enough the value of this. Whether we like it or not, the visual aspect is of significant importance when promoting your asset - both in and out of a sale. See this <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/docs/Asset_Store_Promotional_Asset_Guidelines.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a> for more info on key images.</li>
</ul>
