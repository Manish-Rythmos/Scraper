        <p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Symptoms</span></strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I want to promote my asset to increase my sales</li>
<li>I would like more users to see what&#xA0;my asset has to offer them</li>
<li>I want to give my asset away for a cheap&#xA0;price for a limited time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span></strong> </p>
<p>Sales can increase user purchases of an asset, or attract new users, however it can be a little unclear on how to get on these deals.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span></strong> </p>
<p>If you would like your asset to be included, please apply to join a sale&#xA0;via the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/unity3d.com/forms/d/1eL91dQ2uttWV0hyIPjiYizP98BIxQOfrNx95NfJiLqI/viewform" target="_blank">Sales Application Form</a>.</p>
<p>You can request to be included in a specific sale in the comments box at the bottom of the form. Our Review Team will then decide which assets to put on sale.</p>
<p>It may be some time before your asset is included, as we receive many requests and want to ensure that the promotions include the best assets possible.</p>
