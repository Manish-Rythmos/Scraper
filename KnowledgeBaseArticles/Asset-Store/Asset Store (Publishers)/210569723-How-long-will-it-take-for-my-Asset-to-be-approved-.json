This process cannot be sped up, but making sure all parts of the Asset/package are working and correct will allow your asset to be reviewed more quickly.","Usually the wait time is under two weeks, or 10 working days.","When your package has been approved, its status will change to <em>Published</em> and it will be live in the Asset Store! If your package is not approved, the status of the package will change to <em>Declined</em>. If this is the case, please update your package based on the comments sent to you and resubmit it."]},{"title":"More Information","content":["For more information on submitting Assets and the &apos;Submission Guidelines&apos; please see the following <a href=\"https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/docs/Asset_Store_Promotional_Asset_Guidelines_1.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">link</a>.","If you have had an asset declined, please see this <a href=\"https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/205754275\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> for more guidance.","&#xA0;","&#xA0;","&#xA0;"]}]}]
