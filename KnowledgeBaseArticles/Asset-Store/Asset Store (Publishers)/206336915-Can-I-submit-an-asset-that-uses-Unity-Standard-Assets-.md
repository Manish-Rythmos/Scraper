*   <span>I have made an asset to submit to the Asset Store. I have used a Unity Standard Asset within this.</span>
*   <span>My asset/project uses Unity Standard Assets. I would like to know if I am breaking the Asset Store Provider Agreement by doing this.</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Causes** </span>

<span>Unity Standard Assets are intended for educational purposes while you are learning to use Unity. They are freely accessible to all Unity users, but not to be used within asset submissions of your own.  
</span>

<span class="wysiwyg-underline">**Resolution** </span>

<span>You are allowed to use Unity Standard Assets within your own games and projects. </span>

<span>You are not however, allowed to redistribute any Unity Standard Assets as an asset package, or with very little changes made. You cannot resell it or identically duplicate it. This is restricted - a form of piracy and your asset submission will not be accepted to the Unity Asset Store.</span>
