*   I have found my asset(s) on a torrent site that is allowing anyone to download it for free.
*   I wish to remove my files from a website pirating my assets(s).

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Cause</span>** 

Once a user has your asset files, unfortunately it is technically possible for them to share these on torrent sites. 

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Resolution</span>** 

To remove a torrent, or any other pirated copy of your asset, from a website you should make a DMCA take-down (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) request to the Administrator of that site.

This is a copyright law that implements two 1996 treaties of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

This will allow you to flag a webpage/website for a take-down: http://www.dmca.com/

<span class="wysiwyg-color-red90">*Note: Unity Technologies will not be able to remove assets that have infringed copyrights unless the asset is being distributed on the Unity website/answers/forums or Asset Store.* </span>

**<span class="wysiwyg-underline">More Information</span>** 

If the pirated material is on our own Asset Store, please follow the guidance in this article:
