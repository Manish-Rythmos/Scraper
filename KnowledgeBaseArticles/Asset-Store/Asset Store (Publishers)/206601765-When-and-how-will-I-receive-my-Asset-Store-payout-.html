<ul>
<li><span>I have not&#xA0;received my Asset Store payout</span></li>
<li><span>I want to know which&#xA0;payment methods I receive my payout in</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Causes</strong> </span></p>
<p>There are different methods of receiving Publisher payouts and depending on which you choose, this can affect when and how you receive your funds.</p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>Resolutions</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>There are two payment options for Asset Store publisher payout (Three if you reside in the US):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>PayPal</span><span> &#x2013; Free transactions, No minimum transfer, Monthly transfers</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Wire</span><span> - $20 Transaction fee, Minimum transfer $250, Quarterly transfers</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Cheque</span><span> &#x2013; </span><strong>Available for US publishers only</strong> <span>, $15 Transaction fee, Minimum transfer $250, Quarterly transfers</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Depending on the payment option you have chosen, you will be paid either monthly or quarterly.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>PayPal</em> </strong> <span> - If you opt to use PayPal, you will be paid around the 15</span><span>th</span><span> of each month. You are paid for the month&#x2019;s sales on the 15</span><span>th</span><span> of the next month. For example all Sales up to the end of April will be paid out on the 15th May; Sales from the 1st of May will be paid in June.<br></span></p>
<p><strong><em>Wire</em> </strong> <span> - If you opt to use wire, you will receive your payment quarterly around the 15</span><span>th</span><span> of the month. These quarterly payments fall in January, April, July and October.</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Please note, Publishers should allow some leniency on the payment date specified. There can be delays when transfers are made. For example, if the 15th falls on a weekend.</em> </strong> </p>
<p><span>If you are experiencing problems with Asset Store Payout this can be due to the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Wire transfers can be delayed.</strong>  It is likely that you will need to allow some flexibility around the set payment date of the 15th. &#xA0;Payments can sometimes take until the 21st to clear.</li>
<li><strong>Payments made to PayPal accounts can fail.</strong>  Some countries have restrictions on Paypal, for example Russian and Ukrainian PayPal accounts. This prevents international payments from being received.&#xA0;If your PayPal account is the subject of Asset Store payout failure, we advise that you pick a wire transfer as your payment method.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>If, after having chosen a wire transfer as your payment method, you have made less than the required $250 minimum; your sales will roll over to the next quarter and will be paid when $250 has been reached.</span></p>
