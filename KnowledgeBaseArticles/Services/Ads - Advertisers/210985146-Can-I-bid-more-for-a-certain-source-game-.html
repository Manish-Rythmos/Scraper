        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am an advertiser and would like to bid more for a particular game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to bid more for certain games.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You can bid more for a list of particular source IDs.</p>
<p>In order to do this, you will need to create an additional campaign including&#xA0;the higher bid price and desired targeting. Once you&apos;ve done this, <a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact">contact the AdOps&#xA0;team</a> with the list of source IDs and they will be able to apply this targeting before you set the campaign live.</p>
<p>Source IDs can be retrieved from your tracking provider (for example AppsFlyer, Tune and similar).</p>
