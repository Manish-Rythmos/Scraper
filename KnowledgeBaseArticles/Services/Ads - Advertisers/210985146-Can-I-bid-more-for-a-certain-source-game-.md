*   I am an advertiser and would like to bid more for a particular game.

**Cause** 

You would like to bid more for certain games.

**Resolution** 

You can bid more for a list of particular source IDs.

In order to do this, you will need to create an additional campaign including the higher bid price and desired targeting. Once you've done this, [contact the AdOps team](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact) with the list of source IDs and they will be able to apply this targeting before you set the campaign live.

Source IDs can be retrieved from your tracking provider (for example AppsFlyer, Tune and similar).
