*   I am using Unity Ads and want to increase the number of views that result in an install.

**Cause** 

You would like to spend the entirety of your daily budget but currently you are not generating enough installs.

**Resolution** 

Firstly, it is vital that your video trailer is of good quality and clearly showcases your game so that potential users can make an informed decision as to whether to install your game. We recommend running multiple videos simultaneously to maximise the diversity of in-game content your potential users are exposed to. We also suggest that you refresh your videos every few months if your resources permit.

Secondly, the number of impressions your videos receive are directly linked to your eCPM. The best way to increase your eCPM - and ultimately the number of impressions - is to try increasing your CPI bid price.
