*   I would like to test my ad campaigns - is this possible?

**Cause** 

You have an ad campaign that you would like to test.

**Resolution** 

In order to A/B test multiple creatives, you will need to create multiple campaigns that have a shared budget (as shown in the screenshot below). The system will then automatically run all creatives across the networks and essentially act as an automatic A/B testing system.

There is no requirement for you to remove any creatives from rotation, but if you see a particular campaign performing better than the rest then you can stop the poorer performing one and all budget will shift to the remaining creatives.

Should you require assistance in setting up multiple creatives or any further information, please reach out to the [AdOps team](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact).
