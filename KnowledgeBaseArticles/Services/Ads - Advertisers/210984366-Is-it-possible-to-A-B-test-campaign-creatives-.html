        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to test my ad campaigns - is this possible?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You have an ad campaign that you would like to test.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>In order to A/B test multiple creatives, you will need to create multiple campaigns that have a shared budget (as shown in the screenshot below). The system will then automatically run all creatives across the networks and essentially act as an automatic A/B testing system.</p>
<p>There is no requirement for you to remove any creatives from rotation, but if you see a particular campaign performing better than the rest then you can stop the poorer performing one and all budget will shift to the remaining creatives.</p>
<p>Should you require assistance&#xA0;in setting up multiple creatives or any further information, please reach out to the&#xA0;<a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact">AdOps team</a>.</p>
