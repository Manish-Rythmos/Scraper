        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am using Unity Ads and would like to know the review process for ad campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The campaign needs to be reviewed prior to it being put live.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>We need to review your campaign before it can be put live. As part of the review process, we need to verify the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campaign creatives are in the correct format.</li>
<li>Campaign content is not overly graphic or sexually explicit.</li>
<li>Campaign budget and bids meet the minimum requirements.</li>
<li>Store badges for Google Play do not appear in iOS campaign creatives.</li>
<li>If&#xA0;<a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/s2s-install-tracking">Server-to-Server Install Tracking</a>&#xA0;is being used, the tracking link needs to be validated (not required when using&#xA0;<a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/sdk-install-tracking">SDK Install Tracking</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>To expedite the review process, make sure to follow the requirements laid out in the&#xA0;<a href="http://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/campaign-design-guide">campaign design guide</a>.</p>
<p>If your campaign has been awaiting moderation for more than 48 business hours, please&#xA0;<a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact">contact the AdOps team</a>&#xA0;to follow up on the status of your campaign.</p>
