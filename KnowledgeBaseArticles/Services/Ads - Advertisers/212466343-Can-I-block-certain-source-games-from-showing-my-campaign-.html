<p>You would like to block certain games from showing your ads.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Our system automatically optimizes towards higher quality sources for you so manual optimization isn&apos;t necessary.</p>
<p>Should you see a particular source that isn&apos;t performing for your campaign but still delivers high volume then <a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact">contact&#xA0;the&#xA0;AdOps team</a>,&#xA0;who will be able to make these changes on your behalf.</p>
<p>For this you will need the source ID, which can be retrieved from your tracking provider (for example AppsFlyer or Tune).</p>
