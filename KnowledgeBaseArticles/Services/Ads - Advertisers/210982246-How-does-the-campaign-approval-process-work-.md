*   I am using Unity Ads and would like to know the review process for ad campaigns.

**Cause** 

The campaign needs to be reviewed prior to it being put live.

**Resolution** 

We need to review your campaign before it can be put live. As part of the review process, we need to verify the following conditions:

*   Campaign creatives are in the correct format.
*   Campaign content is not overly graphic or sexually explicit.
*   Campaign budget and bids meet the minimum requirements.
*   Store badges for Google Play do not appear in iOS campaign creatives.
*   If [Server-to-Server Install Tracking](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/s2s-install-tracking) is being used, the tracking link needs to be validated (not required when using [SDK Install Tracking](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/sdk-install-tracking)).

**More Information** 

To expedite the review process, make sure to follow the requirements laid out in the [campaign design guide](http://unityads.unity3d.com/help/advertising/campaign-design-guide).

If your campaign has been awaiting moderation for more than 48 business hours, please [contact the AdOps team](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact) to follow up on the status of your campaign.
