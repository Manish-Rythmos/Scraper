*   I am an advertiser and would like to move money from the monetization account to the advertiser account. Is this possible?

**Cause** 

You have money in the monetization account that you would like to transfer to the advertiser account to be used for advertising needs instead.

**Resolution** 

Due to fiscal reasons, you'll first have to invoice us and then you can send the money to your advertiser account.

**More Information** 

Please note that you will need to meet the minimum advertising budget in order for this transfer to be carried out. Please contact us at [unityads-support@unity3d.com](mailto:unityads-support@unity3d.com) for more information.
