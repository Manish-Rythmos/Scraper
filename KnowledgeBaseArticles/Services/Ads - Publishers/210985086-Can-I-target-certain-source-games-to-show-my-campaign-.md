*   I am an advertiser and would like my ad campaign to appear in certain games.

**Cause** 

You would like to target specific games with your ad campaign.

**Resolution** 

We are not able to target specific games by name as we work with our developers on a blind basis. Typically we recommend that advertisers run their campaigns across the network and let our system optimize to where the best quality install comes from.

Should you have a list of source IDs that performed well for a previous campaign, [contact the AdOps team](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact) to specifically target these and they will be able to add this to the campaign setup before you put it live.

You can retrieve source IDs from your traffic provider, for example AppsFlyer, Tune or similar.
