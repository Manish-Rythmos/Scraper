        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to know if I can invoice Unity for Ads revenue of under $100</li>
<li>Is there a minimum limit I can invoice for Unity Ads?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> &#xA0;</p>
<p>If you have generated less than $100 revenue, you may be wondering how you can claim your revenue.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unfortunately we are unable to process invoices for less than $100. Once your revenue has added up to an amount over $100, please invoice us as usual.</p>
<p>Invoices should be submitted by email to <a href="mailto:accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com">accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com</a>. Unity Ads currently makes payouts via bank transfers. In order to guarantee smooth payment of your invoices, please follow these invoicing instructions.</p>
<p>When you submit your first invoice, you need to send us your bank account information using the Bank Info Form (<a href="https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/WireTransferForm-UnityAds.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/WireTransferForm-UnityAds.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>Then, each time you want to receive a payment you need to send us an invoice. You can download the Unity</p>
<p>Ads invoice template form:<a href="https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/Invoice_example-UnityAds.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://secure.applifier.com/unityads/files/Invoice_example-UnityAds.xlsx</a></p>
