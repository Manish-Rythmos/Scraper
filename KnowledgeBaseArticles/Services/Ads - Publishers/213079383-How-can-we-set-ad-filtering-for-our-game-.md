*   I use Unity Ads to monetize my game and would like to target a specific audience, for example one based on age. Can I do this through the Unity Ads dashboard?

**Cause** 

Targeting a specific audience may help drive traffic to your game.

**Resolution** 

Ad filtering by age group can be done through the Unity Ads dashboard:

1. Log in to the [Unity Ads dashboard](https://dashboard.unityads.unity3d.com/).

2. Select a project from your list of projects.

5. On this page, you will be able to do any of the following:

*   Set the age group on an ad.
*   Set the types of game genre that appear in your game's ads.
*   Set the types of brand ads that appear in your game's ads.

To add filters to your game, you need to **select ** the ad genre that you do not wish to see.

7. Click the button marked **Save**  when you are done to save the changes.

**More Information** 

If you are still seeing ads that are inappropriate for your game, you will need to look at the filters that you have set and include more if necessary.
