*   I have submitted my invoice to [accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com](mailto:accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com) and would like to know if I need to include a VAT number on the invoice.
*   I use Unity Ads to monetize my game and currently reside in Europe.

**Cause** 

The VAT (Value Added Tax) number is required in the European Union. 

**Resolution** 

If you are in the EU then you are required to provide a VAT number on the invoice. The local legislation in each country specifies when you need to apply for a VAT number.

If you do not have it, just state "No VAT" to the field. If you have one, please state it in the corresponding field and also to each invoice in EU format.
