<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>eCPM</strong>   <em>(effective Cost Per Mille)</em>  is the amount you earn per 1000 impressions. The value is determined by the bids of the adverts that are shown in your game and the overall performance.</p>
<p>If the ads in your game perform well - you will have a good eCPM. If your eCPM is low - consider reviewing your integration design and spreading your game to other countries.</p>
<p><em>Tip: If you wish to predict possible earnings then it is best to use the average revenue earned per &quot;daily active users (ARPDAU) as it is a more accurate and useful performance indicator.</em> </p>
