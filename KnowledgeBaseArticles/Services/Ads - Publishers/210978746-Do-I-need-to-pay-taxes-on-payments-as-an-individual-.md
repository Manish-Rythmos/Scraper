*   I elected to be paid as an individual instead of as a company and would like to know if I have to pay taxes for selecting this payment option.

**Cause** 

If you elected to be paid as a private person, the payments are governed by tax agreements between your country and Finland.

**Resolution** 

In general, there are no taxes to be deducted from payments to companies or similar entities. However, if you are a private person, the payments are governed by tax agreements between your country and Finland.

These agreements are in place to reduce any possible double taxation and set guidelines for personal taxation rules. In general, the taxes for ad income are usually between 0 and 15%, but can be higher for certain countries.

You should consult your local tax office for further guidance or ask our support team for specific tax percentages.

**Note:** We will not deduct any tax from your payment - handling taxes for your revenue is your responsibility.

**More Information** 

Please consult your relevant local government agency for advice on taxes when self-employed.
