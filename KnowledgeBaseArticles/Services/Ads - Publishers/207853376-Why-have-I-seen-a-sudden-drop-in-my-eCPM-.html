        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a publisher using Unity Ads in my apps to generate revenue</li>
<li>I have seen a noticeable change in my eCPM and therefore, revenue</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Causes</strong> </p>
<p>The eCPM change is due to a drop in impressions from day to day. When there is a delayed revenue attribution, eCPM can look artificially high because impressions have dropped compared to the previous day/days.</p>
<p>Furthermore, having an average daily number of starts, less than 5,000 per day, will cause bigger fluctuations in eCPM.</p>
<p><strong>Resolutions</strong> </p>
<p>eCPM generally evens out after periods of high impressions and fluctuation. It will therefore be likely, that more consistent statistics will be present in your dashboard in future.</p>
<p>If your eCPM does not return to normal, please do <a href="/hc/en-us/requests/new%20" target="_blank">get in contact with us</a> to investigate your individual case further.</p>
