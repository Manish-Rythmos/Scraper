        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I use Unity Ads to generate revenue for my game.</li>
<li>I would like to know&#xA0;how frequently the stats for my game are updated.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to know how frequently the monetization stats are updated in the Unity Ads dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Hourly statistics are updated a few minutes after the hour and daily statistics 15 minutes past UTC midnight.</p>
<p>The report you can access on the admin panel is not in real time. The report is updated hourly, but the revenue information from the ads can take up to seven days to be reported back to our system.</p>
