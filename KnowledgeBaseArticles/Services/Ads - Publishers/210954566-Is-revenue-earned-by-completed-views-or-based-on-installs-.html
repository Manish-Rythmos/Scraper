        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am interested in using Unity Ads to monetize my game and would like to know how revenue is generated.</li>
<li>I use Unity Ads and want to understand what stats contribute to earned revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Unity Ads generates revenue through generating views and traffic from your game and you get paid based on that.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>There is no &quot;one unified way&quot; of pre-calculating the revenue generated to you, as we run different types of campaigns with different billing points, including completed views, clicks, and installs.</p>
<p>Our algorithm&#xA0;always selects the best possible campaigns for your users, to generate as much revenue as possible.</p>
