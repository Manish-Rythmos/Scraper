*   I would like to customize what statistics I see in my reports.

**Cause** 

You are currently not able to see the desired statistics and would like to be able to do so.

**Resolution** 

You can generate a report for your entire organization by going to the **Statistics** tab on the main Ads dashboard.

From here, you can set the date range and split the data as needed for a report containing all of your games.

You can also use the [monetization stats API](https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/monetization/stats-api) to fetch customized statistics from your game.
