        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a publisher using Unity Ads in my apps to generate revenue</li>
<li>I wish to know how much I can expect to earn</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Publishers based in different countries can earn a range of amounts. This is because there are different amounts of ads available in different countries. The more ads your particular country has, the more you can potentially earn.<br></p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The average eCPM for Unity Ads ranges from $6 - $12. It can be as high as $20 in English speaking countries, or as low as $3 in non-English speaking countries. Revenue is based on the quality of impressions.</p>
