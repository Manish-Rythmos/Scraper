Once we receive your invoice, you should receive your revenue payout within 30 days. Sometimes, this time frame can lengthen due to a high influx of invoices, but we are working on automating payments for the future.Unity Ads currently only offers payments by wire transfer. To request payment, you must submit an invoice to accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com. The minimum earnings balance required to submit an invoice is $100 USD. When you submit an invoice for the first time, you need to include your bank account information via the set Unity form available from our Ads FAQ.More Information","content":["Please see the Unity Ads <a href=\"http://unityads.unity3d.com/help/faq/monetization\" target=\"_blank\">FAQ</a> for further information.
