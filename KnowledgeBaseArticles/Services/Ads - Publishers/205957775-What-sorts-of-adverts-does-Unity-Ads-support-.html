        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a publisher using Unity Ads in my apps to generate revenue</li>
<li>I wish to know which sorts of adverts will appear in my Unity app</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>There are many different types of adverts that are commonly found in apps. Unity does not yet support all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity Ads is a games-only, full-screen, video Ad network. This means that all adverts that appear through Unity Ads are video trailers for other games or apps. At this time, we do not have support for picture advert interstitials, and we do not support banner ads.</p>
