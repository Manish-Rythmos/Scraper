*   I use Unity Ads for my game and see that my game has impressions, but 0 ad requests. How can this be?

**Cause** 

Ad requests are a sampled value.

**Resolution** 

Yes, it is possible to have impressions, but 0 ad requests. 

Impressions are counted each time a video is started. Only every 23rd ad request is recorded due to sampling. If you have only a handful of ad requests per day, only every 13th of them is added to the statistics.
