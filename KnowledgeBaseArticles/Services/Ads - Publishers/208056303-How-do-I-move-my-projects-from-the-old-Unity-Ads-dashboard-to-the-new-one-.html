        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a publisher using Unity Ads in my apps to generate revenue</li>
<li>I wish to transfer my projects to the new in-browser Unity Services Dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We are currently migrating all Unity Ads user accounts to the Unity Developer Network (UDN). This may cause some confusion with which account to use in the Dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To continue using the old Unity Ads admin, you will need login using your UDN account instead of the old Unity Ads login.</p>
<p>We are planning to begin migrating all games from the old Unity Ads admin to the new in-browser Unity Services Dashboard in early 2016. Barring any issues, you should see them all in the new Dashboard by the end of Spring 2016.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that when they are transferred, each game profile will appear as its own project in the new Dashboard.</p>
<p>We will be working on a way to merge projects, or re-associate the platforms (game IDs) of multiple projects under a single project, but this option will not be available right away.</p>
