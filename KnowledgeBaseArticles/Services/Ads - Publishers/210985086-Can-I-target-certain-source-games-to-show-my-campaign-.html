        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am an advertiser and would like my ad campaign to appear in certain games.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to target specific games with&#xA0;your ad campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>We are not able to target specific games by name as we work with our developers on a blind basis. Typically we recommend that advertisers run their campaigns across the network and let our system optimize to where the best quality install comes from.</p>
<p>Should you have a list of source IDs that performed well for a previous campaign, <a href="https://unityads.unity3d.com/help/help/contact">contact the AdOps team</a>&#xA0;to specifically target these and they will be able to add this to the campaign setup before you put it live.</p>
<p>You can retrieve source IDs from your traffic provider, for example AppsFlyer, Tune or similar.</p>
