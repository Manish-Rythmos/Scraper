*   I am a publisher using Unity Ads
*   I wish to edit the name of my project in the old Unity Ads dashboard
*   I wish to edit the name of my project in the new in-browser Unity Services Dashboard

**Cause** 

The process to change the name of a project is slightly different in the old and new Dashboards for Ads.

**Resolution** 

***Old Dashboard** * 

Under the old Unity Ads admin, the name of your game will be updated when you add store details.

***New Dashboard** * 

When you link your store details, the list of platforms for the project will show the game name under the *Game Name* column.

To change the name of the project, you can do so via the settings sections of the Services window in Unity, or from the [Core Services UI](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/).
