*   I cannot login to my Unity Ads account.
*   I receive an error stating that my password is incorrect.

**Cause** 

The reason you need to reset your password may be that:

*   You have entered a password containing uncommon characters and you are now unable to log into your account.
*   You have simply forgotten your password. 

**Resolution** 

Unity Ads now uses the Unity Developer Network (UDN) login system to provide access to the Unity Ads dashboard. You can use the [UDN new password form](https://accounts.unity3d.com/password/new) to reset your account password.
