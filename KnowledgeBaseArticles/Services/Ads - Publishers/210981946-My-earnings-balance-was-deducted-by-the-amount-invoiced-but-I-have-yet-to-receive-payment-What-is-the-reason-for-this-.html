        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I haven&apos;t received my earnings even though the earnings balance was deducted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The payment date is 30 days from receipt of the invoice.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>When you see funds deducted from your account, payment has been processed.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean the funds have been paid - it means they have been approved in our system. The balance in your Unity Ads will not necessarily change immediately after you send the invoice.</p>
