*   I would like to transfer my project to a different Unity Organization.

**Cause** 

Your Project's Organization is specified from the Developer Dashboard.  

**Resolution** 

To transfer a Unity Project from one organization to another, you must be an owner or manager of both organizations. You perform this operation through the [Unity Developer Dashboard](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/projects/). 

*Note: Disabling Unity Services is no longer required for this process.* 

From the [Developer Dashboard Projects](https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/projects/) list, locate the Project you wish to transfer and select **View** .
