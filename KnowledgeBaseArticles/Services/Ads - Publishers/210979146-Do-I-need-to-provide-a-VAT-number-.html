        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I have submitted my invoice to&#xA0;<a href="mailto:accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com">accountspayable-fi@unity3d.com</a>&#xA0;and would like to know if I need to include a VAT number on the invoice.</li>
<li>I use Unity Ads to monetize my game and currently reside in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The VAT (Value Added Tax) number is required in the European Union.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>If you are in the EU then you are required to provide a VAT number on the invoice. The&#xA0;local legislation in each country specifies when you need to apply for a VAT number.</p>
<p>If you do not have it, just state &quot;No VAT&quot; to the field. If you have one, please state it in the corresponding field and also to each invoice in EU format.</p>
