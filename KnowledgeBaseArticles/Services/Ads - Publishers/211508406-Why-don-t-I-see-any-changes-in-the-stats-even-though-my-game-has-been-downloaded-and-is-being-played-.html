        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am using Unity Ads to monetize my game and have noticed that, while the game is being played by users, there are no changes in the statistics. How can this be?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Your game may still have test mode enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>If you do not see any ad requests, your game may still have test mode enabled.</p>
<p>Test mode can be disabled in your Unity Ads dashboard - see our <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/213080523">step-by-step&#xA0;guide to disabling test mode</a>.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>You should also ensure that you are initializing ads with the correct game ID.</p>
<p>The statistics you really want to see changes in are  <strong>ad requests</strong> ,  <strong>starts</strong> , and  <strong>views</strong> . It&apos;s possible that impressions, eCPM, and revenue could be static for a while.</p>
