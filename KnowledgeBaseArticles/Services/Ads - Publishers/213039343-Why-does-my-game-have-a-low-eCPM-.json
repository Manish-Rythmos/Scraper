If ads are shown before gameplay, the content is not as relevant to the player as your game currently would be, so they&apos;re simply waiting to get back to the game.</li>\n<li>Generally it&apos;s better to show only opt-in rewarded ads instead of a mix of opt-in rewarded and compulsory rewarded as the compulsory ads reduce the novelty of the opt-in ones. Showing fewer ads usually helps the important placements to perform better.</li>\n"]},{"title":"More Information","content":["The reason you may see different eCPM for different countries is because the advertisers bid differently for each country, and in some countries the bids are lower. You will see better results if you get more traffic globally."]}]}]
