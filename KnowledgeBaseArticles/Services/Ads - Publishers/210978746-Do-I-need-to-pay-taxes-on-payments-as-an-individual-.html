        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I elected to be paid as an individual instead of as a company and would like to know if I have to pay taxes for selecting this payment option.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If you elected to be paid as a private person, the payments are governed by tax agreements between your country and Finland.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>In general, there are no taxes to be deducted from payments to companies or similar entities. However, if you are a private person, the payments are governed by tax agreements between your country and Finland.</p>
<p>These agreements are in place to reduce any possible double taxation and set guidelines for personal taxation rules. In general, the taxes for ad income are usually between 0 and 15%, but can be higher for certain countries.</p>
<p>You should consult your local tax office for further guidance or ask our support team for specific tax percentages.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  We will not deduct any tax from your payment - handling taxes for your revenue is your responsibility.</p>

<p>Please consult your relevant local government agency for advice on taxes when self-employed.</p>
