*   I haven't received my earnings even though the earnings balance was deducted.

**Cause** 

The payment date is 30 days from receipt of the invoice.

**Resolution** 

When you see funds deducted from your account, payment has been processed.

However, this does not mean the funds have been paid - it means they have been approved in our system. The balance in your Unity Ads will not necessarily change immediately after you send the invoice.
