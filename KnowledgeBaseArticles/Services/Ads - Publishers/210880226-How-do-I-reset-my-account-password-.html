        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot login to my Unity Ads account.</li>
<li>I receive an error stating that my password is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The reason you need to reset your password may be that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have entered a password containing uncommon characters and you are now unable to log into your account.</li>
<li>You have simply forgotten your password.&#xA0;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity Ads now uses the Unity Developer Network (UDN) login system to provide access to the Unity Ads dashboard. You can use the&#xA0;<a href="https://accounts.unity3d.com/password/new">UDN new password form</a>&#xA0;to reset your account password.</p>
