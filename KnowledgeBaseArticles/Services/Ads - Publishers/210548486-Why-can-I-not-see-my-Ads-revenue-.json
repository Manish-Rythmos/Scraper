You will be getting revenue based on the quality of your user impressions.","Unity Ads generates revenue through generating views and traffic from your game, and you get paid based on that.&#xA0;There is no &quot;one unified way&quot; of pre-calculating the revenue generated to you, as we run different types of campaigns (with different billing points, for example completed views, clicks or installs).&#xA0;Our system always selects the best (in terms of money) possible campaigns for your users.","&#xA0;"]}]}]
