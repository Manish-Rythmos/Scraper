        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to test if video ads are shown with test mode disabled from my project. Am I able to do this?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to test if live ads are being shown in your game with test mode disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>It is against the&#xA0;<a href="https://unity3d.com/legal/ads-publishers-terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>&#xA0;to distribute live ads to beta testers. If they are to click or install any of the advertised games, their activity will be monetized and the automated fraud system would flag the game for fraud and disable it. Therefore,&#xA0;we encourage leaving test mode enabled until the game is ready to launch.</p>
<p>If you need to test rewarded integration, we recommend leaving test mode enabled to prevent your game from being flagged for click fraud.</p>
