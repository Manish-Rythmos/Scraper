<li>I am no longer working on a project that was using Unity Ads. Can I remove this project from my dashboard?</li>

<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to know if it is possible to remove a project that has&#xA0;Unity Ads from your dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Yes, you can do&#xA0;this by archiving the&#xA0;project.</p>
<p>1. Go to&#xA0;<a href="https://developer.cloud.unity3d.com/projects/">the developer dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>2. Select the project in question.</p>
<p>3. Go to the  <strong>Settings</strong>  tab and click the button to archive it.</p>
