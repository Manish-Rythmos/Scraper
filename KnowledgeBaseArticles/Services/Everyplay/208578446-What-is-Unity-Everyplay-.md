*   I would like to know what Unity Everyplay is.

**Cause** 

You may be wondering what Everyplay is and how it may benefit your game by being integrated.

**Resolution** 

Everyplay is a service that allows your users to record their gameplay and upload it to the following social media sites:

*   Twitter
*   Facebook
*   Youtube

This feature allows your users the chance to share their experiences within your game with the Community and their friends. As your players share your game's replays, their friends will try it out too. Have your players market your game FOR you through word of mouth.
