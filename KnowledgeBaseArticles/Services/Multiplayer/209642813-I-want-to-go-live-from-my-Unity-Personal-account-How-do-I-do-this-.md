*   I am a Unity Personal Edition user
*   I wish to 'Go Live' with my Unity Multiplayer game

**Cause** 

As Unity Multiplayer is a new Service, initially we have set it to Go Live only through a Pro license holder's account.Â 

**Resolution** 

We are currently improving our backend systems to allow us to recognize Personal Edition users who have a payment instrument on file.

For now, if you are a Personal Edition user who wishes to Go Live with your game, please [contact us](/hc/en-us/requests/new%20) and we will see what we can do to help.

**More Information**
