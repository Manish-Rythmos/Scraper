        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>&#xA0;I would like to know what the Unity Multiplayer framework in Unity is made up of</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>I would like to know how&#xA0;Unity Multiplayer is structured&#xA0;and how I can expect to utilize it for my project.&#xA0;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity Multiplayer contains several different facets:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>High Level APIs (HLAPIs) </strong> makes it easy easy to implement and prototype networked features. &#xA0;</li>
<li><strong>Low Level APIs (LLAPIs) </strong> let you optimize network code for your game.</li>
<li><strong>Matchmaker Server helps your players find game sessions so they can play with each other.</strong>  <strong> &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#xA0;</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Relay Server </strong> routes traffic between players to ensure reliable, stable connections that would otherwise be hampered by point to point connections (NAT, firewalls, etc).</strong> </li>
</ol>
