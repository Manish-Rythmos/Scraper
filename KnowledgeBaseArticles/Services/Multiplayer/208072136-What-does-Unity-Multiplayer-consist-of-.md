*    I would like to know what the Unity Multiplayer framework in Unity is made up of

**Cause** 

I would like to know how Unity Multiplayer is structured and how I can expect to utilize it for my project. 

**Resolution** 

Unity Multiplayer contains several different facets:

1.  1.  **High Level APIs (HLAPIs) ** makes it easy easy to implement and prototype networked features.  
    2.  **Low Level APIs (LLAPIs) ** let you optimize network code for your game.
    3.  **Matchmaker Server helps your players find game sessions so they can play with each other.**  **         ** 
    4.  **Relay Server ** routes traffic between players to ensure reliable, stable connections that would otherwise be hampered by point to point connections (NAT, firewalls, etc).**
