        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to implement Unity Multiplayer but need to know the costs.</li>
<li>I wish to know how much I can expect to pay for this service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You want to make a multiplayer game and would like to know an estimate of the cost.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity offers a free amount of Concurrent users (CCU) for each license.</p>
<p>- Personal:&#xA0; <strong>20 Concurrent Users</strong> </p>
<p>- Plus:&#xA0; <strong>50 Concurrent Users</strong> </p>
<p>- Professional:&#xA0; <strong>200 Concurrent Users</strong> </p>
<p>If you need to increase the number of CCUs that your game supports then you can set this when you submit a live request via the multiplayer dashboard. If you do this, you will be charged $0.49/ GB of traffic that travels through the Unity infrastructure (Matchmaker, Relay Server). This means that you pay for the extra bandwidth that you use.</p>
<p>We also have a way to <a href="https://unity3d.com/services/multiplayer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimate your monthly bill</a>. This can be found by scrolling to the bottom of&#xA0;the multiplayer page.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>For more information on how the pricing system was worked out, please see the Multiplayer Development Lead&apos;s <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-multiplayer-launch-faq-march-2016.392474/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forum post</a>.</p>
