        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>My build is failing with the error below:</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/hc/en-us/article_attachments/203149933/ProjectSubdirectoryError.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This error is caused when&#xA0;the ProjectSettings and Assets folders are contained within a sub-directory of the folder targeted by Unity Cloud Build in your source code repository.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You can create a new target and define the name of the SubDirectory. Cloud Build will then know to look in this SubDirectory for the project it needs to build.</p>
