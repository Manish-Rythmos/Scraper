Select the console and install the app again. It will show the exact cause of the problem in the console.","The iOS build download says <em><strong>No Install - Your device is not provisioned for this build</strong>.</em>&#xA0;A very likely cause for the message&#xA0;<em>No Install - Your device is not provisioned for this build&#xA0;</em>is that your UDID is not registered in the development or distribution mobile provisioning profile. You can visit <a href=\"https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/login/me\">https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/login/me</a> on the device and send your build manager the details directly via the <em>Email this Info</em>&#xA0;option. The project needs to be rebuild after adding the UDID and uploading the new provisioning profile so update the build.

You should always use the UDID reported by iTunes. Â ","content":["In rare occasions, the current session of the device is broken. This may occur, for example, when you apply a backup of your phone, or the session cookies get corrupted. In such a case, please reset the device by visiting device reset page <a href=\"https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/device/reset\">https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/device/reset</a>&#xA0;which will redirect you to the Unity Cloud Build page after resetting the device session info. If not, please visit it <a href=\"https://build.cloud.unity3d.com/\">manually</a> and log out and log in again to finish the reset process correctly.&#xA0;","Additionally, ensure you are using Safari not in private mode. Unity Cloud Build is not guaranteed to work in other browsers on iOS. Furthermore you can clear the Cache and Cookies of Safari in the Settings menu under &apos;Safari&apos;.&#xA0;","&quot;When I try to download the build it shows <strong><em>Unable to Download App</em></strong>&#xA0;as iOS dialog popup.&quot; If you are having this error appear, your connection might not be stable enough to download the build. Please ensure with your ISP that the connection is stable. If you are in doubt, test a different connection such as over 3G or wired connection. Please also ensure that you have enough free space on your device.","Additionally, it might be possible that the certificate used for the provisioning profile was revoked or deleted. In this case you need to update the certificate and regenerate the provisioning profile. After updating the files via the Unity Cloud Build dashboard, please make sure to rebuild the app, otherwise the change will not have the desired affect.
