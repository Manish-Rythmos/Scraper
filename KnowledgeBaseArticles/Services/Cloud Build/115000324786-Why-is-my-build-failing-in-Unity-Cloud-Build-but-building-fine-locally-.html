        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>My game builds fine locally, but it fails in Unity Cloud Build.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>There are a number of reasons why this could happen, but the most common cause is not&#xA0;adding all your files to your source control.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Sometimes your source control won&apos;t have all the files that your local machine has. First, you should check if it builds locally&#xA0;from a fresh checkout by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone/checkout your Project into a new directory from source control.</li>
<li>Open the Unity Project in the same version of the Editor that you are trying to build with in Cloud Build.</li>
<li>Build a version of your Project for the same platform you are targeting in Cloud Build.</li>
<li>Verify that the errors received in your Cloud Build log are not apparent during this local build.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it still looks fine locally, try doing a clean build from the dashboard (see below).</p>
