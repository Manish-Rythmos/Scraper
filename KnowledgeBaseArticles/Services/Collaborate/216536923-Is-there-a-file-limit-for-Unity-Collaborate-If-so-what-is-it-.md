*   I am interested in using Unity Collaborate and would like to know if there is a maximum file amount to upload. 

**Cause** 

You are a current user or are interested in using Unity Collaborate and would like to know if there is a file limit for uploading.

**Resolution** 

There is no total limit to the number of files. A maximum of 10,000 files can be uploaded at one time. If the project contains more files, simply press upload again and the remaining files will be uploaded.
