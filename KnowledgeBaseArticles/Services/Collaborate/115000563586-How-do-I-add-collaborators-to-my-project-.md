*   I want to add members of my team to my Unity Collaborate project.
*   I don't know how to share my project with the members of my organization.

**Cause** 

You would like to add users to your Collaborate project.

**Resolution** 

There are multiple ways that you can start collaborating with your teammates.

First, you will need to ensure that you are [added to the organization](https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206494363?flash_digest=5b70b4cd427b7454a65b034ae07430f363d9599c) that the project was created under. If you are already added, ensure that you are a Manager (or Owner) for that organization.

If you want someone to have access to all of your organization's projects that are currently on Collaborate, make them an Owner or Manager of the organization. When they open the Unity Editor, they will see an **In The Cloud**  option for opening projects.

This option is not viable for all users. If you just want someone to have access to particular projects, not all of them, you can use the  **Invite Teammate**  option found in the Collaborate panel in the Editor.

You will then be able to enter the email address of the user you'd like to add to the project.

Now your teammates will have access to the project. They can download it via the Collaborate panel, and push their changes as they work on the project.
