*   You have created a new project and wish to enable Unity Collaborate.

**Cause** 

You may not be able to find the Collaborate option under the Services tab, as this Service is currently only available in Unity 5.5 and later.

**Resolution** 

**1.** Once activated in Unity 5.5 or later, open up the Services tab and enable the Collaborate Service

This will create a new project in the Organisation that your project is currently enabled with.

**2.** When changes are made to the project you should see the *Collab* button change as shown in the screenshot below.

**3.** Clicking this button will show you a commit message box and a list of the assets that have been changed.

The Files shown with a plus icon have been added and those with the cross are files that have been removed.

Your Project will now be set-up, ready for other team members to pull from the Cloud.Â
