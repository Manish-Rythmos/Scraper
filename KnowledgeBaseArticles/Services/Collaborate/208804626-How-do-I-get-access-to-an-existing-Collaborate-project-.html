<ul>
<li>&#xA0;I am trying to access a existing Unity Collaborate project</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may be wondering how to gain access to a Unity Collaborate project and/or make pull requests.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>First you will need to ensure that you are <a href="https://support.unity3d.com/hc/en-us/articles/206494363?flash_digest=5b70b4cd427b7454a65b034ae07430f363d9599c" target="_blank">added to the Organization</a> that the project was created under. If you are already added, then ensure that you are a Manager for that Organisation.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  Open the project on your machine&#xA0;by&#xA0;opening up the Editor and when presented with the project window, click &quot;In the Cloud&quot;.</p>

<p>Then click on the project that you need a copy of.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  You will then need to select or create an empty folder. Unity will download and place the current version of the project inside. Once this is done, the Editor will open the project and you will be able to start developing.</p>
