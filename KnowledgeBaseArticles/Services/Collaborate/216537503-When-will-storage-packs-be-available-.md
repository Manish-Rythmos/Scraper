*   I am interested in using Unity Collaborate and would like to know if more storage can be purchased.
*   I currently use Unity Collaborate and am interested in purchasing more space. Is this currently being offered?

**Cause** 

You are interested in knowing if storage packs are currently being offered for purchase. If they are currently not being offered, you would like to know when you will be able to purchase.

**Resolution** 

Storage packs are not currently available for purchase, but will be purchasable in the first half of 2017.
