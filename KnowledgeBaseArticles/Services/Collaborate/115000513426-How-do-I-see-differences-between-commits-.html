        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I&apos;m using Unity Collaborate and I&apos;d like to see what has changed before I commit.</li>
<li>I would like to calculate and display the differences between two files that myself or my teammates have committed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to see the differences between committed files before submitting your changes.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>In the Collaborate toolbar, you can get a high overview of all the changes that have been made. If you hover over a single change, an eye icon will appear.</p>

<p>Clicking this opens your diff tool with changes highlighted.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>Ensure you have a diff tool installed and linked up to Unity. If you do not already have one, <a href="http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/index.html" target="_blank">DiffMerge</a> is free and cross-platform.</p>
<p>To use a diff tool with Unity, go to the  <strong>P</strong>  <strong>references</strong>  menu, click&#xA0; <strong>External Tools</strong> , and change the diff tool via the drop-down menu next to&#xA0; <strong>Revision Control Diff/Merge</strong> .</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>  The eye icon will only appear after pulling another team members&apos; changes if anything is different to your local copy. Unity Collaborate does not currently support diffing two files that have already been committed.</p>
