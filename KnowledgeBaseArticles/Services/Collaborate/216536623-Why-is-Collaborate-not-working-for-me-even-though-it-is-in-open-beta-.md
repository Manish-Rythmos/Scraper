*   I am a project owner and my other teammates are able to use Unity Collaborate, but I am not able to. 
*   I am trying to push a build on Collaborate, but am still unable to see the “Collab” button in the Editor after logging out and logging back in. 

**Cause** 

You may still be using an older version of Unity. You and your Unity Organization may also not have been properly whitelisted.

**Resolution** 

It is possible that you are using Unity 5.4. Please note that Collaborate Open Beta is only available in 5.5. 

To join the Beta, go to the [Collaborate home page](https://unity3d.com/services/collaborate) and click 'Join now'.

**More Information** 

We recommend using the most recent version, but if you need access to Unity Collaborate in 5.4, please [contact us](mailto:collabsupport@unity3d.com).
