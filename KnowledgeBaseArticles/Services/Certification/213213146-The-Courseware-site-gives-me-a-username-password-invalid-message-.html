        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot log in to the Courseware link with my Unity ID because I am told my username or password is invalid. </li>
<li>Resetting my password does not work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may be signing in with an account that does not have access. Alternatively, there is a known error with the site path that can result in this problem. We are investigating this at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Apologies for the inconvenience. Log into<a href="https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso"> https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso</a> with the account that should have the Courseware access. This takes you directly to the Courseware pages. We recommend that you bookmark that link for future use.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>Note: If your Courseware was included in a Unity Plus, Pro, or Enterprise license purchase, you must assign each of your Courseware users a license seat.</p>
<p>If you purchased your Courseware as a standalone item, this does not apply.</p>
