*   I have taken the Unity Certification Exam
*   The time limit ran out before I was able to finish the Exam
*   I have failed the Exam and wish to retake

**Cause** 

The Unity Certification Exam has a time limit of 90 minutes to answer 100 questions. The pass mark for the Exam is 70%.

**Resolution** 

Developers who reach the time limit before completing the exam will receive a score based on what they have completed at the point when the time limit is reached. Since the pass mark is 70%, it may be that you will pass despite not answering the last few questions.

If you do however wish to retake your Exam, you are allowed up to 2 attempts per year for any Certification exam. Each attempt will incur an individual exam fee. Retakes are available at 50% off the regular price.

**More Information** 

Individual Developers will be able to retake the Exam at their point of entry - the Event or site used.

For Educational users and Studios, retakes will need to be set up through our [Sales Team](https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales).
