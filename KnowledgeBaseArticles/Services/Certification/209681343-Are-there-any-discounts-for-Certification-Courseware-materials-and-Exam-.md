*   I am interested in purchasing Unity Certification Courseware and taking the Exam.
*   I wish to know if I qualify for any discounts to the purchase price.

**Cause** 

Unity often have discounted deals available, and the same is true for our Certification Courseware and Exam prices.

**Resolution** 

Once Courseware and Exams are available for purchase, this will be handled through our [Website](https://certification.unity.com/) for individual Developers and through our [Sales Team](https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales) for Educational and Studio users.

***Studios and Wholesale Purchases* ** 

Studios or commercial organizations wishing to offer Unity Certification to a group may qualify for discounted pricing. Please speak to Sales for more information.

***Educational Purchases* ** 

Educational institutions who wish to offer Unity Certification to their students may be eligible for discounted pricing. Please speak to the Sales Representative for your region. We do not offer a student discount for Certification.
