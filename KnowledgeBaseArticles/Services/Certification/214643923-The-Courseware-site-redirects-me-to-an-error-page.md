*   I cannot log in with my Unity ID.
*   After I enter their Unity ID username/password, I am redirected to [https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso/error](https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso/error).

**Cause** 

We are currently investigating the cause of this sporadic login failure.

**Resolution** 

Clear your browser cache. If this does not work, sign in on the Unity ID page([id.unity.com](http://id.unity.com)) as usual, then visit [https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso](https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso) to be redirected into the Courseware site.

**More Information** 

Note: If your Courseware was included in a Unity Plus, Pro, or Enterprise license purchase, you must assign each of your Courseware users a license seat.

If you purchased your Courseware as a standalone item, this does not apply.
