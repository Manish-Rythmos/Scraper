        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I cannot log in with my Unity ID.</li>
<li>After I enter their Unity ID username/password, I am redirected to <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso/error">https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso/error</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>We are currently investigating the cause of this sporadic login failure.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Clear your browser cache. If this does not work, sign in on the Unity ID page(<a href="http://id.unity.com">id.unity.com</a>) as usual, then visit <a href="https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso">https://unity3d.com/unity-docebo-sso</a> to be redirected into the Courseware site.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>Note: If your Courseware was included in a Unity Plus, Pro, or Enterprise license purchase, you must assign each of your Courseware users a license seat.</p>
<p>If you purchased your Courseware as a standalone item, this does not apply.</p>
