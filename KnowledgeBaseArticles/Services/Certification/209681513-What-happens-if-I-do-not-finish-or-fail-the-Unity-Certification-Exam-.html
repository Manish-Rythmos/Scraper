<ul>
<li>I have taken the Unity Certification Exam</li>
<li>The time limit ran out before I was able to finish the Exam</li>
<li>I have failed the Exam and wish to retake</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The Unity Certification Exam has a time limit of 90 minutes to answer 100 questions. The pass mark for the Exam is 70%.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Developers who reach the time limit before completing the exam will receive a score based on what they have completed at the point when the time limit is reached. Since the pass mark is 70%, it may be that you will pass despite not answering the last few questions.</p>
<p>If you do however wish to retake your Exam, you are allowed up to 2 attempts per year for any Certification exam. Each attempt will incur an individual exam fee. Retakes are available at 50% off the regular price.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>Individual Developers will be able to retake the Exam at their point of entry - the Event or site used.</p>
<p>For Educational users and Studios, retakes will need to be set up through our <a href="https://store.unity.com/contact?type=sales" target="_blank">Sales Team</a>.</p>
