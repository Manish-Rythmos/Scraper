*   I am a developer and use Unity Analytics in my game.
*   I would like to communicate with the users of my game information regarding their use of the game and would like assistance drafting a privacy policy.

**Cause** 

You would like to provide the users of your game a privacy policy that includes information regarding your game and their use of it.

**Resolution** 

Unity Technologies is not able to provide legal advice regarding Privacy Policies or Terms of Service for games as it may implicate Unity Technologies if a legal dispute were to arise. We recommend that developers consult a lawyer for legal advice and refer to local laws to ensure that everything is in compliance with their privacy policies.
