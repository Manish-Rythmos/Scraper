        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a developer and use Unity Analytics in my game.</li>
<li>I would like to communicate with the users of my game information regarding their use of the game and would like assistance drafting a privacy policy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You would like to provide the users of your game a privacy policy that includes information regarding your game and their use of it.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unity Technologies is not able to provide legal advice regarding Privacy Policies or Terms of Service for games as it may implicate Unity Technologies if a legal dispute were to arise. We recommend that developers consult a lawyer for legal advice and refer to local laws to ensure that everything is in compliance with their privacy policies.</p>
