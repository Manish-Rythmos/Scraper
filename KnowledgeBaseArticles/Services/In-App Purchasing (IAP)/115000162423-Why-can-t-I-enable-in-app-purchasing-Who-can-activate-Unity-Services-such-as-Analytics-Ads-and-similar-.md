*   I'm trying to enable in-app purchasing in the Services window of the Unity Editor and it's not working.

**Cause** 

A common cause of this issue is when a memberÂ is not an Owner or Manager of the organization

**Resolution** 

IAP and other Unity Services can be enabled by an organization's project managers and owners. Members with the "User" role do not have this permission.

Please [contact support](https://analytics.cloud.unity3d.com/support/) for additional help enabling IAP.
