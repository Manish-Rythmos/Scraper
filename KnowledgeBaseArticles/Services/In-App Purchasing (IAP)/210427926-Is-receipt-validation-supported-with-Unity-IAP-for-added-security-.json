This allows the&#xA0;server to verify if the user&apos;s purchase is valid. This will&#xA0;then check&#xA0;any In App Purchases that require an external download."]},{"title":"Resolution","content":["Currently, yes it is possible to add validation for purchase receipts locally and remotely.","Unity IAP provides additional local support for iOS and Google Play receipt validation, with instructions <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPValidatingReceipts.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.","For other store platforms, the complexity varies by platform and receipt verification details are not covered here. Generally though, you can extract the receipt for a given product and pass it through cryptographic verification. Access platform specific receipts by first accessing the Unity IAP Product&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Purchasing.Product-receipt.html\" target=\"_blank\">receipt field</a> and then accessing its payload for the platform <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPPurchaseReceipts.html\" target=\"_blank\">specific receipt</a>."]},{"title":"More Information","content":[]}]}]
