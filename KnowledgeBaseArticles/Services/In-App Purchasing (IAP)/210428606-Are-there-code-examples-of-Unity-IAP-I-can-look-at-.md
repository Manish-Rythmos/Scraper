*   I would like to see code examples of Unity IAP 

**Cause** 

Example code and scenes can help make the whole In App Purchasing system much easier to understand.

**Resolution** 

Yes! An example scene/script comes with the Unity IAP plugin, titled *IAPDemo* . The relevant files can be found in the scenes and script folders of the Plugins/UnityPurchasing/ folder.  You can also find a tutorial for setting up Unity IAP [here](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/analytics/integrating-unity-iap-your-game) as well as additional samples in this repository: [https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/unity-iap-samples](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/unity-iap-samples)
