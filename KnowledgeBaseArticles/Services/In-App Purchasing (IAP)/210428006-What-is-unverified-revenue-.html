        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to know what unverified revenue is</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You may be able to see an amount marked as  <em>Unverified Revenue</em>  in your account.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>Unverified revenue is revenue that cannot be validated with the relevant app store.</p>
<p>Unverified revenue can come from a few different sources. If the receipt parameter of a transaction is null for either iOS or Android, the system will categorize the revenue as unverified. This is also true if the signature parameter is null for Android.</p>
<p>When receipt and signature (on Android) values are being correctly passed in, revenue can still be considered as unverified if the app store says it is invalid. This can happen with revenue generated from testing, or from fraudulent purchases.</p>
