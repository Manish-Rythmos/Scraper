<ul>
<li>I would like to understand how product restoration works.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>App users on  <strong>iOS</strong>  need to type in their Apple password to restore purchases, it is required to provide a button to restore purchases, and a method which calls the RestoreTransactions method of the IAppleExtensions.</p>
<p>App users on  <strong>Android</strong>  will not need to do anything, Android will handle it for you automatically.</p>
