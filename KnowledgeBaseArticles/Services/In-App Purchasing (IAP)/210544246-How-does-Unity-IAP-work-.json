The identifiers are strings that refer to the different products.","If you are using different stores, and your products have different identifiers in each store, then this is here you can define each one&#x2019;s identifier.","Please take a look at the <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityIAPDefiningProducts.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a> for more information."]},{"title":"Listen for Responses:","content":["Next, we have Unity IAP listen to responses by using the &quot;IStoreListener&quot; interface.

The method takes a string (the product&apos;s identifier) and checks if this product exists and is ready to be sold. If the product exists and is ready to be sold, then we supply the product to the customer."]},{"title":"More Information","content":[]}]}]
