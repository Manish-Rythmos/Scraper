        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I&apos;ve implemented an in-app purchase store in my game with Unity, but&#xA0;in some countries the price that I&apos;ve defined is different from what users are being charged.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>This can be an issue with the app store&apos;s VAT settings, meaning the store is adding tax to the price that you determined and is thus causing it to be higher than your game states.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You will need to let the store know that your price includes VAT - see <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/138000">Google Play&apos;s documentation on tax rates and VAT</a> for more information.</p>
