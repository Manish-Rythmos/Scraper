You can find each variable in the object listed with its value and type, for example:\n\nm_Name is the variable name\n“” is the value \n(string) is the type\n\nYou can break down every variable in this way with array types listed with indents.\nUsing this text file, you should be able to determine exactly what is in your Scene bundle.\nMore InformationIf you need to see the Assets included in a non-Scene bundle, you can open the manifest file (.manifest), which is generated in the same root folder as the Asset bundle. Inside the manifest file you will find a list of Assets under the Assets: scope.\nThe screenshot below shows what a manifest file looks like. Note that you can see “Assets/MyImageName.png” under the Assets: scope - this is the filepath to the Asset included in this bundle. Each Asset included in the bundle will be listed here. \n\nYou can also load the bundle and each object from the bundle to see exactly what’s inside it.\nSee the AssetBundle API and AssetDataBase API for more utility functions.\n\n\n\n\n","content":[]}]}]
