This means you are trying to access to a previously loaded Assetbundle, like this:","AssetBundle bundle = www.assetBundle;\n","And you haven&apos;t unloaded it with <a href=\"https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AssetBundle.Unload.html\">AssetBundle.Unload</a> yet."]},{"title":"This also applies for AssetBundle variants because the only difference between them are the individual Assets contained in it and the variant name, which is appended to the AssetBundle Name to identify it. However, when loaded they are considered the same AssetBundle, so it is not possible to load more than one variant of an AssetBundle at the same time. Resolution","content":["Keep track of loaded AssetBundles and unload them when you are no longer using them.
