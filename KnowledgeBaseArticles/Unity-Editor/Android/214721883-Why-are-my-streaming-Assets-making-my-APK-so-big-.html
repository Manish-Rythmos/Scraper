        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>My files in the  <strong>StreamingAssets</strong>  folder are not being compressed in the APK.</li>
</ul>
 <strong>Cause</strong> 

<p>The APK is a normal zip file. Files within this&#xA0;file can use a range of compression methods, with the most common being  <strong>deflate</strong>  and  <strong>store</strong> .&#xA0;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deflate</strong>  is the normal zlib/lz77 compression algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Store</strong>  is uncompressed raw data, stored as is.</li>
</ul>
The Unity-generated APK will contain files of both kinds, with the StreamingAssets data &#x200B;always&#x200B; using store&#xA0;compression.

&#xA0;
Unity will read the (usually compressed) data from inside&#xA0;the APK file. However, Streaming Assets are left &quot;as is&quot;, and are copied directly into the file structure.


<p>Also note that this is the file itself and not the Unity-formatted file used elsewhere. This can be seen by adding a large PSD&#xA0;image file to the StreamingAssets&#xA0;folder, which can then be found inside the APK by extracting its&#xA0;contents and looking at the file inside the extracted Assets folder.</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>


<p>If compression is required for the&#xA0;StreamingAssets, this compression must be in the file itself, for example:</p>


<ul>
<li>Use a file format that is compressed (for example PNGs and&#xA0;JPGs) - do not use large file formats (such as PSDs)&#xA0;unnecessarily as these will be copied uncompressed.</li>
<li>Use compressed AssetBundles.</li>
<li>Reduce the sizes of the Asset files themselves using compression tools such as <a href="http://pngcrush.com/">PNG Crush</a><em>.</em> </li>
</ul>
