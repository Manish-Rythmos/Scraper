        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to know if Unity games require additional redistributables (for example&#xA0;Visual Studio Runtime, DirectX, or&#xA0;.NET)?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>Sometimes PC games require additional files to be included with the installation. When shipping with Steam there is a list of redistributables it can automatically install for a game.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>If you&#xA0;use&#xA0;DirectX, it makes sense to let Steam install it, but you do not need the Visual Studio redistributables, or the .NET runtime.</p>
