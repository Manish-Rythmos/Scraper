Sometimes you need to get pixels from a texture without having to set the texture as readable, similar to how the Unity Editor does it to get preview images from Textures.\nResolutions\nYou can use a RenderTexture to do that, take a look at the following code:\n \n\"texture\" is the texture you want to read which is not marked as readable in importsettings:\n \n\n// Create a temporary RenderTexture of the same size as the textureRenderTexture tmp = RenderTexture.GetTemporary(                     texture.width,\n                    texture.height,\n                    0,\n                    RenderTextureFormat.Default,\n                    RenderTextureReadWrite.Linear);\n// Blit the pixels on texture to the RenderTextureGraphics.Blit(texture, tmp);\n// Backup the currently set RenderTextureRenderTexture previous = RenderTexture.active;\n// Set the current RenderTexture to the temporary one we created\nRenderTexture.active = tmp;\n// Create a new readable Texture2D to copy the pixels to it\nTexture2D myTexture2D = new Texture2D(texture.width, texture.height);\n// Copy the pixels from the RenderTexture to the new TexturemyTexture2D.ReadPixels(new Rect(0, 0, tmp.width, tmp.height), 0, 0);\nmyTexture2D.Apply();\n// Reset the active RenderTextureRenderTexture.active = previous;\n// Release the temporary RenderTexture\nRenderTexture.ReleaseTemporary(tmp);// \"myTexture2D\" now has the same pixels from \"texture\" and it's readable.\n\n \nYou can now get/set pixels from \"myTexture2D\".\nMore Information\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.GetTemporary.html\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Graphics.Blit.html\nhttp://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture2D.ReadPixels.html\n ","content":[]}]}]
