*   When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:

warning CS0108: `___' hides inherited member `___'. Use the new keyword   
if hiding was intended

**Cause** 

The CS0108 warning is displayed when a variable was declared with the same name as a variable in a base class, but does not use the new keyword.

Errors displayed in this example:

warning CS0108: `PixelPerfect.camera' hides inherited member   
`UnityEngine.Component.camera'. Use the new keyword if hiding was   
intended

**Resolution** 

To remove the CS0108 warning, you will need to either add the new keyword to the variable being declared:

Alternatively, you can change the variable's identifier to avoid confusion with collaborators as in this example:
