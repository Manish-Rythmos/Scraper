*   I am getting the error below appearing in my console:

error CS0120: An object reference is required to access non-static   
member `____'

**Cause** 

There are a few causes of this and they are listed below:

**1.** This is caused when a static method is attempting to use a non-static variable by referencing it directly.

Error this example presents:

error CS0120: An object reference is required to access non-static   
member `MyScript.name'

**2.** This error is also generated when a non static method is called from a static method like so:

member `MyScript.MethodB()'
