*   When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:

error CS0664: Literal of type double cannot be implicitly converted to type `float'. Add suffix `f' to create a literal of this type

**Cause** 

The *CS0664 * error is caused when a number with a decimal place is entered when declaring a float but does not include the`f' suffix. Please see the example below.

**Resolution** 

The error *CS0664 * is resolved by adding the `f' suffix to the end of the value that you are assigning to the float. See the example below.
