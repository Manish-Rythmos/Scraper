When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:

error CS0119: Expression denotes a `___' where a `___', `___' or `___'   
was expected

**Cause** 

The *CS0119* error is caused when a new type is created using a constructor in an incorrect way.

In this example we are trying to create a new variable of type [*RectTransform* ](http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RectTransform.html).

Here is how the error appears in this example:

error CS0119: Expression denotes a `type' where a `variable',`value' or `method group' was expected

**Resolution** 

When using C# you need to use the **new** keyword in front of all constructors. Constructors are like functions that are used to create new objects (or scructs). They always have the same name as the type of object you are creating.
