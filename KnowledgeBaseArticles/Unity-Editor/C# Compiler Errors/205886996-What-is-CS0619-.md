*   You try to access a member of a class/type and you get the following error:

error CS0619: ________ is obsolete: `_________ is not supported any more. Use _______'

**Cause** 

This happens when a class member was marked with the Obsolete attribute (when the entity is no longer recommended for use), such that an error will be issued when the class member is referenced.

**Resolution** 

*   **<u>Example:</u>** 

error CS0619: `UnityEngine.GameObject.PlayAnimation(UnityEngine.Object)' is obsolete: `gameObject.PlayAnimation is not supported anymore. Use animation.Play()'  

*   **<u>Solution:</u>**

Use the recommended member that appears in the error message.
