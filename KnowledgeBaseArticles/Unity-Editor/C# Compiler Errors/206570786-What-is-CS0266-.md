When trying to enter play mode, I am receiving the error below:

error CS0266: Cannot implicitly convert type double' to float'. An explicit   
conversion exists (are you missing a cast?)

**Cause** 

The CS0266 error is caused when trying to assign the value of a double to a float.

**Resolution** 

The error CS0266 is resolved by either casting the double's value as a float, or by using a float instead of a double. Please see the example below for guidance:
