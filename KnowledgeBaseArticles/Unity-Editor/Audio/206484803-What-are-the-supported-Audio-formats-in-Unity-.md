*   I want to import an Audio Asset into my game.
*   I want to know which audio format I should use.

**Cause** 

You want to use an Audio Asset in Unity and you would like to know which audio formats are supported in the editor. 

**Resolution** 

Unity supports importing the following audio file formats:

*   **.aif* * 
*   **.wav* * 
*   **.mp3* * 
*   **.ogg* * 

The following tracker module file formats are also supported:

*   **.xm* * 
*   **.mod* * 
*   **.it* * 
*   **.s3m* * 

The tracker module assets works the same way as any other Audio Assets in Unity except waveform preview can be rendered to the Asset Import Inspector
