These can be either hand painted in a paint package, pasted from photographs and worked into to remove light information, adjusting values, or rendered out from a high res model in your 3D package. You can look up these values from the following <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/StandardShaderMaterialCharts.html\" target=\"_blank\">charts</a>.","You can also try using further textures with values from the charts to apply surface parameters such as:","\n<ul>\n<li>Normal Maps</li>\n<li>Specular or Metallic</li>\n<li>Smoothness&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n"]},{"title":"More Information","content":["This article applies to Unity versions 5.0+","More information about the Standard Shader and PBS systems can be found in <a href=\"http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/02/18/working-with-physically-based-shading-a-practical-approach/\">this blogpost</a>.&#xA0;"]}]}]
