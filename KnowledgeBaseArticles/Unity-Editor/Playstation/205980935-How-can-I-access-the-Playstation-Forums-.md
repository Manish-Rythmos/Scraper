*   I have received my Unity Playstation license from Sony
*   I would like to gain access to the Playstation developer forums

**Cause** 

Forums are a useful tool for interacting with other developers and solving common problems, not to mention networking. We do not however have a PS developer area within our Unity Forums in the way that we do for XBox developers.  

**Resolution** 

Unity does not have a dedicated Playstation area in our forums. We advise all our PS developers to talk to their Sony representatives about gaining access to this [forum](http://scedev.net/).
