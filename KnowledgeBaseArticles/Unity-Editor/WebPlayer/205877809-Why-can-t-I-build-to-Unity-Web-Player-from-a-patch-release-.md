*   I am using a new patch release, but I cannot update Web Player.

**Cause** 

If you are trying to load a Web Player build from Unity after recently updating to the latest patch release, you may receive this error message:

*"Failed to update Unity Web Player"* 

**Resolution** 

You cannot build and release a Web Player game with a patch release, as the runtime will not be updated with patch versions.

It is recommended that you create a Web Player build using the latest official Editor patch release instead.

**More Information** 

You can find out more information about the specific bugs fixed in each patch release by looking at the Unity QA patch releases archive [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases)
