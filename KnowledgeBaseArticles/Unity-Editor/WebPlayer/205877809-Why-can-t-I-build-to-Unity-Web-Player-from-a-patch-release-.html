        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>I&#xA0;am using a&#xA0;new patch release, but I cannot update&#xA0;Web Player.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If you are trying to load a Web Player build from Unity after recently updating to the latest patch release, you may receive this error message:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Failed to update Unity Web Player&quot;</em> </p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>You cannot build and release a Web Player game with a patch release, as the runtime will not be updated with patch versions.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you create&#xA0;a Web Player build using the latest official Editor patch release instead.</p>
<p><strong>More Information</strong> </p>
<p>You can find out more information about the specific bugs fixed in each patch release by looking at the Unity QA patch releases archive&#xA0;<a href="https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases" target="_blank">here</a></p>
