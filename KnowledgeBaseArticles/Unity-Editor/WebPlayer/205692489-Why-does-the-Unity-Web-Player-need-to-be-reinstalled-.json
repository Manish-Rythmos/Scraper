These can block the connection to our servers. Please try allowing these ports in your settings: 80 and 443.</span>","<span>2) You have an anti-virus software that is blocking the connection. Please try disabling this and seeing if the Web Player will work.</span>","<span>3) You are using Google Chrome. Chrome now blocks plug-ins by default. To get around this if you are using a version of Chrome before 45, you can type &#x2018;About:Flags&apos; into the URL space and then enable NPAPI. Alternatively, you could try the game in a different browser.</span>","<span>4) You have a weak or intermittent Internet connection - this is less likely than the points above.</span>","<span>Please try the suggestions in points 1-3.

We are encouraging our developers to move their games to WebGL as a result. Please see this blog post for more details: http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/10/08/unity-web-player-roadmap/","content":[]}]}]
