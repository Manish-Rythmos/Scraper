*   I am receiving the error below:

BCE0044: expecting ____, found "____

**Cause** 

The first error ('expecting') is cause by a UnityScript error on line 5 of the code where the computer was expecting a closing curly bracket, but found nothing there. It indicates that the right closing curly bracket is missing from this line.

The second error ('found') is caused by a missing opening curly bracket on line 2. The computer will consider the closing curly bracket on line 3 an unexpected token, because it has no value without its opening curly bracket.

**Resolution** 

Make sure the script is correctly structured as shown below:
