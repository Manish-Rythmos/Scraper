<ul>
<li>I have found a bug within my project</li>
<li>I am experiencing a bug in&#xA0;the UI system</li>
<li>I am experiencing trouble with a game on Facebook</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>If Unity is not working like you expect it to this may be due to a&#xA0;technical problem. You may have experienced an issue similar to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have experienced a crash which has closed Unity and is preventing you from re-opening the editor</li>
<li>You are receiving an error in your Console.</li>
<li>You are experiencing trouble with a published game. This can be caused by a bug in the Unity Web Player</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>The first port of call is to check our <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Forums</a> and <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Answers</a> pages. It may be that our Community of users have resolved the issue and posted publicly there.</p>
