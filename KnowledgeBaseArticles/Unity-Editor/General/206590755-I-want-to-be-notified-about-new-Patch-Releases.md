*   I want to be alerted via email whenever a new Patch is released.

**Cause** 

You may wish to know the minute a new Patch is released if it contains a bug fix which is helpful to your project.

**Resolution** 

There are a couple of ways to be notified about a new Patch Release:

To see the latest Patch Releases you can either go directly to the QA Patch archive [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/patch-releases)

Or, you can subscribe to this [thread.](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/unity-patch-releases.246198/)

If you want to be notified of new Patch Releases, you can click on the  **Watch Thread**  command, which can be found just above the first post on the page. This lets you tell the Forum system to send you an email whenever a new post is made to the thread.

***Please note, you will have to specify if you want to be notified by email; the default setting is to notify you through only your forum profile/control panel.* **
