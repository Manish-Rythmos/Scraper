*   I would like to display Unity in its Pro/dark skin.
*   I have upgraded to Unity Pro but the Editor is still in the light skin. 

**Cause** 

The dark skin option can only be applied in Unity Plus or Pro. If you have Unity Personal activated unfortunately this feature is not available.

**Resolution** 

If you have upgraded your license from Personal to Plus or Pro, first update your serial in the Editor, then follow this process:

1. Open up the Unity Editor and open one of your projects. 

2. Click the "Edit" drop down menu in Windows, or "Unity" for Mac/Linux.

3. Click "Preferences" 

4. The Preferences window will appear:

5. Under the "General" tab, select "Professional" next to  "Editor Skin"
