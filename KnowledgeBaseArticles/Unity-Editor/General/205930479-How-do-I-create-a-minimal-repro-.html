        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>My project is too large to submit via the Bug Reporter. I want to find out if&#xA0;there a way I&#xA0;can simplify the upload</li>
<li>I want to speed up the process of reporting my bug</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>You are experiencing a bug in Unity and want report this via the Bug Reporter. The Bug Reporter&#xA0;requests you&#xA0;attach a project to it, but your project is too large.</p>
<p>To produce a minimal sized project for upload you can create a minimal reproducible (repro)  rather than upload your entire project. This will not only make for a faster upload and reproducibility of your issue, but as a bonus it can help you troubleshoot it yourself before submitting.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p>To create a minimal reproducible:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you have made a back up of your project.</li>
<li>
<p>Open your project in Unity and open the affected scene</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove extraneous items from the scene - assets not required to see issue</p>
</li>
<li>Right click on the scene file in project view and  <strong>Export</strong>  the scene as a package.</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new project entirely and name appropriately</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import your scene package into a new scene and make sure you fix and replace any missing scripts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click Play or Build to test your issue is still applicable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to  <strong>Help &gt; Report a bug</strong> &#xA0;where the whole new minimal project will be attached</p>
</li>
</ol>
