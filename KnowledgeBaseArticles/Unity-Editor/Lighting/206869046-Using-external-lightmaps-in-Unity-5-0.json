Yet, an automated process like hitting the bake button resulted in lots of changes that were highly likely to cause merge conflicts in the scene files. <br>In Unity 5, the properties that are needed to use external lightmaps are only serialized when there is a build. This helps to avoid the merge conflicts. Therefore, if you change one of the parameters and load the scene, the changes will not show."]},{"title":"Resolution","content":["To use external lightmaps, you need to&#xA0;have:","\n<li>your external lightmap in a folder</li>\n<li>a script that can create a&#xA0;<a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/LightmapSettings-lightmaps.html\" target=\"_blank\">LightmapSettings.lightmaps</a>&#xA0;array in which you can store your external lightmaps (You could do this by creating a public data array type to be shown in the Editor and just drag your lightmap to the slot created).</li>\n","Then you need to reference the object&apos;s renderer and assign the external lightmap by accessing the lightMap&apos;s array index (<a class=\"externalLink\" href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Renderer-lightmapIndex.html\" target=\"_blank\">Renderer.lightmapIndex</a>).
