You can set this lightmap static toggle separately to the Static toggle in the inspector to create particular situations where you want to batch render game object but not have them lightmapped. In the case of requiring the object to baked and use lightmapped shadows, we need to ticket the lightmap static toggle.&#xA0;</li>\n"]},{"title":"More Information","content":["Quality settings <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-QualitySettings.html\" target=\"_blank\">REF</a>","Light component <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Light.html\" target=\"_blank\">REF</a>","Mesh renderer <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html\" target=\"_blank\">REF</a>","Light performance <a href=\"http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LightPerformance.html\" target=\"_blank\">REF</a>","This article applies to Unity versions 5.x","&#xA0;","&#xA0;"]}]}]
