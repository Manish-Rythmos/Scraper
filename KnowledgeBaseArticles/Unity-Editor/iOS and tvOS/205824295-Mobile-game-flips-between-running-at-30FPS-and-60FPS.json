Unlike other platforms there is no way from your application to unlock the frame rate so that your applications displays as fast as the device can render.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","content":["\n<div class=\"line number3 index2 alt2\">\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">Android and iOS&#xA0;devices use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_synchronization#Vertical_synchronization\" target=\"_blank\">vertical synchronization</a> to update the screen contents at a fixed interval.

Unity&#xA0;then has to prepare the frame buffer within the next frame duration. If this cycle continues the result is a frame rate of 30 fps, as the frame buffer is updated only for every other screen refresh cycle.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">This means the only frame rates possible on an mobile&#xA0;device are frame rates resulting from integer numbers divided by the screen refresh rate (60 Hz).</span></p>\n</div>\n"]},{"title":"\n\n\n\nResolution\n\n\n\n","content":["\n<div class=\"line number3 index2 alt2\">You have two main&#xA0;options to resolve the problem:</div>\n","<span class=\"wysiwyg-font-size-medium\">1.
