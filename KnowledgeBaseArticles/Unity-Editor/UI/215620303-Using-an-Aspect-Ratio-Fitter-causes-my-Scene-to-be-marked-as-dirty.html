        <p><strong>Symptoms</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The root canvas in my Scene has an Aspect Ratio Fitter added onto it, which is causing my Scene to be marked as dirty.</li>
</ul>

<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">The Scene becomes dirty because of&#xA0;the canvas wanting to set the size of its  <strong>RectTransform</strong> . Due to the Aspect Ratio Fitter also changing the size during the initialization, the Scene becomes dirty and leads to an unsaved change.&#xA0;</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left"><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-left">You can still use the Aspect Ratio Fitter but need to place a new, empty GameObject below the canvas group. Moving the Aspect Ratio Fitter from the root canvas group to the new, empty GameObject will stop the Scene from being&#xA0;marked as dirty.</p>
