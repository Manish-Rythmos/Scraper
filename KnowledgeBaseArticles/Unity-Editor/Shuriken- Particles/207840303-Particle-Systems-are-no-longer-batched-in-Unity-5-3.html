         <strong>Symptoms</strong> 

<ul>
<li>The&#xA0;particle systems in Unity 5.3 are not being batched correctly.</li>
</ul>

 <strong>Cause</strong> 
&#xA0;

<ul>
<li>Since Unity 5.3.0, particle systems are no longer batched into single draw calls.</li>
<li>In Unity 5.3.4p2 and Unity 5.4.0B12, particle batching has been reintroduced.</li>
</ul>

&#xA0;
 <strong>Resolution</strong> 
&#xA0;
Unity 5.3.0 Notes:
&#xA0;
This version of Unity introduced a new multi-threaded particle  <em>backend</em>  which does not allow for batching, but should provide better performance&#xA0;and it is used&#xA0;for calculating each of the particle&apos;s properties, positions/sizes, etc.
&#xA0;
A lot more of Unity&apos;s&#xA0;code has been multi-threaded for 5.3, which means we&#xA0;can expect significant performance improvements on multi-core platforms, allowing us&#xA0;to have more particles for the same performance cost compared to previous versions.
&#xA0;
We have seen examples of some systems being up to 5&#xA0;times&#xA0;faster compared to previous versions of Unity, though the&#xA0;results will depend on the type of the effects that are being implemented.
&#xA0;
Unity 5.3.4p2 Notes:
&#xA0;
Dynamic batching for particles was reintroduced&#xA0;again in 5.3.4p2 and 5.4.0B12 with the exclusion of Mesh particles. Particle systems need to follow the same rules as mesh renderers to be batched and use the same material.
